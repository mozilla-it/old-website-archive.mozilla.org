<p>This FAQ and cross reference will help us find unused keystrokes, look
for patterns, see what has or hasn't been implemented and have consistency in
our UI. We want implementers to follow this spec, so if you wish for something
other than what's here, please let us know where the spec falls short. Before
suggesting changes, make sure to read this entire FAQ, as it spells out our current
policies and our reasons for them.</p>
<p>We realize it's a good idea to leave as many keystrokes open as possible, for
future expandability. If you see keystroke commands in the spec that are superfluous,
let us know so we can clear more space. Some hotkeys may end up being relegated
to a special configuration file or preference, for the particular set of users
that need them.</p>

<h2><a name="xref">Cross Reference</a></h2>
<p>Here's an outline of all the global hot keys in Mozilla, for the browser,
editor, mail-news and widgets. This document does not discuss underlined menu
accelerators and the like, as those are part of i18n.</p>

<li><i>Hotkey</i>: a key with a binding that crosses widget boundaries,
and can act globally in the current window.</li>

<li><i>Shortcut</i>: ambiguous term, could mean any kind of keystroke command.
Not used in the spec.</li>
<li><i>Accesskey</i>: an attribute in HTML or XUL for defining an accelator. A
letter in the command name that corresponds to the accesskey is usually underline.</li>
</ul>
<h2><a name="platforms">Four Major Platforms</a></h2>
<p>We define the keyboard combinations for 4 major platform groups. Our spec currently
only deals with the first three - it doesn't talk about OS/2. At some point, we may
fold in the OS/2 keyboard information.</p>
<ul>
<li>Windows (includes BeOS)</li>
<li>UNIX (includes Linux)</li>
<li>Mac OS</li>
<li>OS/2 (these keybindings are set by IBM)</li>
</ul>
<h2><a name="modifiers">Modifier Key Policies</a></h2>
<p>What's the modifier key situation? When is Ctrl/Shift/Alt/Cmd used?</p>
<h3>One "Accel" Key per Platform</h3>
<p>For hotkeys, we normally use only one accelerator key per letter. On Mac
we default to Cmd and on everything else we default to Ctrl.
The accel letter combination can also be used with shift for a related command.
When defining keystrokes in XBL, modifier="accel" is mapped to the appropriate
key for that platform.</p>
<p>There are several reasons for this limitation of 1 accel key. First, Mac OS
only offers the Cmd key for acceleration, since Alt+Letter combinations are reserved
for entering special characters in text. Mac OS applications are not supposed to
use the Ctrl key modifier for commands, and Mac users do a double-take when they
are told to use such a key combo.</p>
<p>UNIX systems provide a special challenge: the need to support legacy Emacs
keybindings that may conflict with Mozilla keybindings. For example, in Emacs <kbd>Ctrl+A</kbd>
moves the caret to the beginning of a line, but in Mozilla, Accel+A is the select
all command. Which should win out? In 4.7, we worked around this by having Alt as
the default accelator key. However, this goes against the expectations of many newer
users, as well as the default behavior of the Gnome and KDE environments. If we
consider a secondary accel key key for Unix systems, we have to consider it is possibly
already taken up by an Emacs key binding.</p>
<p>A final issue is that HTML defines the accesskey attribute, which allows page authors
to define accelerators for webpages, usually indicated with underlined letters. Where
possible, a modifier key should be reserved for accesskeys.</p>
<p>Therefore, while it may be desirable to use Alt as a secondary accel key on the
Windows platform, this would leave it as the sole beneficiary of those bindings, and
we would still need to find another key combination for the other two platforms. So far,
it's been simpler to try finding consistent key combinations that work for all platforms
at once. This means that for hotkeys, we can only assume one modifier key per letter,
with and without shift.</p>
<h3>No Ctrl key combos on Mac OS</h3>
<p>The Mac human interface guidelines ask developers to use Cmd, not Ctrl.
Using Ctrl for hotkeys would confused many Mac users. We can, however, offer
Ctrl combinations for user-defined keystrokes (once we start offering keyboard
configurability).</p>
<h3>Use "Accel" key with letter and number keys, specify exact modifier for
other keys</h3>
<p>In our spec, the Accel key is the key that can change between Ctrl, Alt or
Cmd, thus changing what modifier is used with different letters. For all other
keys (numbers, function keys, navigation keys and editing keys like Delete and
backspace), our spec says exactly what modifier is used in each command combination.
For example, <kbd>Alt+Left</kbd> always means "Go to previous page in history". For
Ctrl+ combos, we general say Ctrl/Cmd(Mac), to show that Ctrl is used on Windows
and UNIX for this command, and Cmd is used on the Mac.</p>
<h3>No Ctrl+Alt combinations</h3>
<p>On international keyboards Ctrl+Alt is used to access accents and other special
characters. Even UK keyboards have 6 Ctrl+Alt keystrokes (11 if you count upper
case): á, é, í, ó, ú (acute accentuated vowels)
and EUR (Euro currency symbol <kbd>Ctrl+Alt+4</kbd>).</p>
<p>In addition, Ctrl+Alt+Letter combos are traditionally reserved on Windows
for defining user application startup hotkeys. This isn't set in stone, so if
we really start running out of keys, perhaps we can change this policy.
For now, consistency is a good thing, and we don't need them.</p>
<h3>Try to group related functions together on the same key</h3>
<p>For example, we try to reserve Accel+Shift+Letter for
commands that are related to Accel+Letter, where possible.
This makes our interface more elegant, and makes the hotkeys easier to
remember.</p>
<h3><a name="punctuation">Avoid modified punctuation keys</a></h3>
<p>Many keyboards from around the world don't support the punctuation you
might expect (some don't even have semicolon!). You also can't assume that
two punctuation characters are on two different keys. For example,
comma may be on a different key from period, or may be on the same key.
Also, a punctuation key may be shifted on some keyboards and unshifted
on others, and a binding which specifies an unshifted key won't work
if shift is pressed (and vice versa). So, while some of our
hotkeys can be reassigned by the i18n team, it's a good idea to use punctuation
combos for non-essential things, so that we don't lose much if the key isn't
available. Here's a set of
<a class="ex-ref" href="http://www-306.ibm.com/software/globalization/topics/keyboards/registry_index.jsp">international
keyboard layout diagrams</a>.</p>
<h3>Emacs editor bindings always go on Ctrl</h3>
<p>Emacs bindings are currently available only on the UNIX platform.
On some letters, there is an accel binding, and a
ctrl(unix) binding.
When these two bindings conflict (as in Ctrl-A or Ctrl-H),
the emacs binding wins. Most of the time, the bindings will follow
focus, so e.g. if the focus is in an editing field, the editing
binding will be used, if the focus is in the browser content area,
the browser binding will be used. More information on this in the
open issue below.</p>
<h3>Open Issue: The default UNIX accel key is Ctrl</h3>
<p>The default accel key was Alt in Netscape 4.7.
A good reason for keeping Ctrl is to be consistent with Gnome and KDE.
A good reason for making it Alt, is that more of the Emacs key bindings are
then available for use. Reasonable people disagree on this issue.
To learn how to switch your accel key, see
<a href="https://www.mozilla.org/unix/customizing.html#accelkey">the customizing document</a>.
It may be desirable to build a pre-made keyboard configuration file for users
who want pure-Emacs style control. Akkana Peck has reopened this issue. If
you feel strongly either way, please email mozilla-accessibility@mozilla.org
with your preference.</p>
<h2><a name="macintosh">Macintosh Keyboard Differences</a></h2>
<p>Not all Macintosh keyboards are the same.  For example, older macs may
not have any  function keys at all, newer Macs have F1-F12, very few
have F13-F15 (F13-F15 are usually labelled Print Screen,
 Break etc on PCs). When function keys are present, Mac OS allow users
to define their actions (macros). For these reasons we want to avoid
the only key binding for a feature being on a function key. If the
feature is important or common, it must have an alternative means
of activation.</p>
<p>Some Macs are missing keys like "insert" or "end" or "pageup" or
"del". The Backspace key is labelled "delete" and represented in menus
by an icon, "enter" is a key on the numeric keypad and the key PC users call
"enter" is labelled "return". Some have separate "help" keys while others
have "help" on the "insert" key. Some have a "clear" key. The layout of
keys like Insert, Delete, Home, End, etc. may be different from keyboard
to keyboard. That's just the US English keyboards: in other words, the fewer
assumptions you make, the happier the users will be.</p>
<p>Mac OS does not have a built in way of walking through the menubar with
the keyboard. Mac OS reserves Alt (Option), and Alt+Shift letter combinations for
inserting special characters and those required by non-English languages.</p>
<h3>Open Issue: <i>Should keys that OS X has taken over be replaced?</i></h3>
<p>As of OS X, <kbd>Cmd+M</kbd> and <kbd>Cmd+H</kbd> are taken over by the system for the "mimimize
windows" and "hide window" commands. Mozilla and Netscape 4.7 used these for
"new mail" and "history". We've even heard that <kbd>Cmd+M</kbd> now crashes Mozilla under
Mac OS X. Are these commands now and forever relegated to using the mouse with pull
down menus on Mac? Should we invent new keys for those commands in OS X? Should we
make an exception in this case and use Ctrl? We need an avid Mac user who loves
keyboard commands to step forward on issues like this.</p>
<p>Another important fact is that we're already going against platform UI guidelines
with our Accel+N behavior. The standard on Windows and Mac OS is for Accel+N to open
a new document or window of the appropriate kind, depending on the application. For
example, Accel+N should open a new browser window in Navigator, a new empty document
in Composer, a new message composition in Mailnews and a new card in the address book.
Users would use the Accel+digit hotkeys if they wanted a keyboard command to jump straight
to a different application.</p>
<ul>
<li>The argument against change, is that we'll be changing what people are already
used to. Perhaps we should have done it this way from the start, but what happens if
we change these common things right under our users' feet?</li>
<li>The argument for change, is that it's better to do the right thing now, than to
assign some strange keystroke for new message compose for Mac users, onlu to
possibly change it later. We should follow platform standards, and get
rid of our strange use of Accel+N.</li>
</ul>
<h2><a name="tab">Current and future Tab key behavior in the content
window</a></h2>
<p>Currently, Tab navigates through all links and form elements in a page</p>
<h2><a name="userdefn">Avoiding function keys for crucial roles</a></h2>
<p>Avoid using function keys for important functionality, or provide other
equivalents on Mac OS. This is because the Macintosh generally reserves function
keys for user defined actions. Some Mac keyboards have no function keys at all.</p>
<h2><a name="destructive">Potentially Destructive Keys</a></h2>
<p>Certain keystroke combinations are reportedly often hit by mistake by users
intending to type something else. Those keys should only invoke undoable or
non-destructive actions</p>
<p>Here's our current list of easy-to-mistype keystrokes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Modified Enter</li>
<li>Modified Space</li>
</ul>
<p>Keys that are easily hit by accident should not invoke an immediate, undoable,
destructive action. For example, if <kbd>Ctrl+Enter</kbd> was used for immediate mail send,
someone might send a rude email before having the chance to edit it. To get
around this, we will have <kbd>Ctrl+Enter</kbd> bring up a dialog "Send mail now?" with a
checkbox that lets the user avoid the extra question in the future.</p>
<h2><a name="accesskeyconflicts">Accesskey Conflicts</a></h2>
<p>Web pages can use the accesskey attribute to define keyboard accelerators for
their page. For example, on www.microsoft.com/enable, pressing <kbd>Alt+S</kbd> initiates a site
search. However, <kbd>Alt+S</kbd> is also supposed to pull down the Search menu in Mozilla's menu
bar.</p>
<p>At this point in time, our solution will be the same as Internet Explorer's.
If there is a conflict, the web page's accesskey will get the key.
If a user specifically wants to go to the main menu, they will type the menu access
key first (normally Alt by itself), then the letter corresponding to the accesskey
(such as S for search).</p>
<p>Right now we have disabled Alt as the menu access key in UNIX, because Alt+click can
have meaning. To get around this, we need to fix the Alt menu access code to check for
a click.</p>
<h2><a name="configurability">Keyboard Configurability</a></h2>
<p>It is now possible to build your own keyboard configuration.
We still need to fix some places where Mozilla hard codes specific keys,
for example the TAB key is hard coded for link and form navigation
in nsEventStateManager.cpp. There are a number of other keys that are defined
in the chrome, but are packed away in .jar files. We don't have a solution
for changing those easily yet, either.</p>
<p>At some point, we may get someone to build a keyboard configuration front-end.
For now, our solution is to have the user edit text files. We can also provide
some pre-build keyboard configuration files (any volunteers?). For example, someone
may provide bindings for Emacs, Opera or Lynx users. Opera and Lynx have quite a
few single keystroke commands in the browser. Single key bindings are great for
users that have a great deal of difficulty typing. It also necessitates the use
of a "leave form controls" key.</p>
<p>It is possible to allow users to associate javascripts with a key. This would
allow users to match a favorite URL to a specific key. We would especially love to see
someone come up with an easy way for end-users to create macros in Mozilla.</p>
<p>See
<a href="https://www.mozilla.org/unix/customizing.html#keys">the customizing document</a> to learn how
to use keyboard configurability.</p>
<h2><a name="codersummary">Summary for Coders</a></h2>
<p>For key combos using letter and number keys, the
<a href="https://www.mozilla.org/access/keyboard/interactive">main cross reference table</a> often lists accel as a
modifier. If you use "accel" in XBL Mozilla will automatically choose the right
key for you, even if the user changes it in their preferences. For other keys,
(function keys, punctuation, etc.) we explicitly say "Ctrl(Win+Unix) or Cmd(Mac)"
to indicate this will always be the key used, even if "accel" is otherwise
redefined by the user. Even in this case, we still prefer "Command" over "Control"
on the Mac because "Control" is used for context menus and very few end user
programs use it as a modifier key.</p>

<h3>Keyboard Coding Rules</h3>
<ul>
<li>Never hardcode keynames. Use string bundles. This is also essential
for localization, so there is no excuse.</li>
<li>Avoid making important features available only on non-alphanumeric
keys (punctuation, numbers and
function keys), these might not be present or easy to type on Mac or
non-US keyboards.</li>
<li>For combos using letter or number keys, use "accel" or "shift,accel"
in XBL.</li>
<li>For other key combos be explicit: use "ctrl", "alt" and "shift"
on Windows and Unix; use "meta", "alt" and "shift" in the Mac keybindings file.</li>
</ul>
