This folder contains specific content archived (and removed) from www.mozilla.org as part of the Legacy Migration Project[0]. It does not contain the entire www.mozilla.org website.

The contents of this folder are self-contained web archives; in other words, they contain all of their requisite files (images, stylesheets, javascript). They are not indexed anywhere, because they’re not meant to be browsed. They are linked from various places, and are almost certainly the target of various redirects from the live www.mozilla.org site.

Once archived, the content here should not change. There is no plan to maintain it, there is no process for modifying it. If content requires ongoing maintenance, it should not be archived here. 

However, this folder is intended to accommodate future archival efforts. New folders of archived data can be added anytime.

This folder is managed by Mozilla’s Web Productions group[1].
