<p><a name="NPL"><b>"Netscape Public License"</b></a>
<br>We wanted an easy name that people could remember.  We also wanted
a name that is distinguishable from other licenses, so we shied away
from more generic names like "Source Code License".

<p><a name="Mozilla"><b>"Mozilla"</b></a>
<br>We used "Mozilla" rather than Netscape for several reasons.  First,
"Netscape Communicator" is a trademarked name that we want to reserve
for our branded products.  Mozilla helps to differentiate between them
and what many people will soon be developing from the Source Code.

<p>The mozilla.org version is derived from Netscape Communicator
Standard Edition, but there are several critical differences of which
the following are examples.  First, we've removed the cryptographic
capabilities of the Netscape product due to US export control issues.
We've also removed code licensed from third parties which Netscape
doesn't have the right to license under the NPL.  Finally, we may
remove some functionality for patented inventions which Netscape may
not have the right to distribute in Source Code form at this time.


<p><a name="Original_Code"><b>"Communicator client code"</b></a>
<br>We used "Communicator client code" because the code being released
is the mozilla.org version of the Netscape Communicator Standard
Edition product.


<p><a name="Modifications"><b>"Modifications"</b></a>
<br>This is a very important definition, as it specifies precisely what
code you write must be made public and what you can keep.

<ul>
<p><li> If you change anything within one of the files contained in the
  Source Code, that is a Modification, and it must be made publicly
  available in source code form.

  <p><li> If you take code out of one of the files contained in the Source
  Code and place it in a new file, whether you add new code or not, that
  is a Modification, and it must be made publicly available in source
  code form.

  <p><li> If you rename a file or combine two or more files contained in
  the Source Code, that is a Modification, and it must be made publicly
  available in source code form.

  <p><li> However, if you add a new file that does not contain any of the
  Original Code or subsequent Modified code, it <b><i>is not</i></b> a
  Modification, and need not be made publicly available in source code
  form.  This remains true even if the new file is called or referenced
  by changes you made in the Source Code, though those changes do
  constitute a Modification and must be made publicly available in
  source code form.  Having said this, though, Netscape believes that it
  is in the interest of all who develop on the Communicator code base to
  contribute their changes back to the development community.  In this
  way, they will reap the benefits of distributed development.

</li></p></li></p></li></p></li></p></ul>
<p> This definition also refers only the modifications themselves, not
the complete file as modified. Later in the License, we require that the
Source Code to Modifications be made available, and this way a developer
need only post his changes to the Source, not the entire source in
changed form.  This should cut down on the need for quite a bit of FTP
space.

<p><a name="Covered_Work"><b>"Covered Work"</b></a>
<br>This means any software or code that is covered by this License.


<p><a name="Initial_Developer"><b>"Initial Developer"</b></a>
<br>In this License, the Initial Developer is Netscape Communications
Corporation.  We used a generic term like "Initial Developer" in the
hopes that this License might be useful for other code and other
Initial Developers.


<p><a name="Initial_Developer_Branded_Code"><b>"Initial Developer's Branded Code"</b></a>
<br>In this case, Netscape Communicator Standard Edition.  We've used
this general definition instead to make the License more useful as a
template or guide for others who wish to issue their source code.


<p><a name="Source_Code_License"><b>"Source Code License"</b></a>
<br>This is the part of the License in which it is spelled out precisely
what permissions the contributors to the Source Code are granting.

<p><a name="Patent_Grant"><b>"Patent Grant"</b></a>
<br>The current draft was derived from the basic principles below.

    <p>1.  It is not OK for someone to create a Modification for which
    he or she has a patent, make the Modification available free of
    charge as required under the License, and then come back and try to
    charge everyone for the patent rights.

    <p>2.  On the other hand, the patent rights of contributors should
    be protected in a manner consistent with the goal of the License.

<p><a name="Public_Availability_of_Source_Code"><b>"Public Availability of Source Code"</b></a>
<br>This provision is intended to ensure availability of code, while
minimizing the burden on each Contributor.  It does not require that you
return Modifications to mozilla.org or any other named organization.
However, you may do so if you choose, and we hope that you wish to
participate in the development community that mozilla.org is chartered
to foster.

<p><a name="Existing_Third_Party_Claims"><b>"Existing Third Party Claims"</b></a>
<br>We considered whether we should prohibit the use of any
functionality where a contested intellectual property claim exists. But
because these claims are often in contention, or unclear, or limited in
their geographical scope so that they do not apply in some areas, we
decided that this would limit the range of products that could be
created from the Mozilla Communicator code too severely. Instead, we
decided that contested intellectual property claims should be clearly
disclosed so that each developer understands to the greatest extent
possible the intellectual property issues surrounding the Source Code.
This will help them to choose, on a case-by-case basis, whether or not
they are interested enough in using the functionality to deal with the
rights issues that surround that functionality.

<p><a name="Required_Notices"><b>"Required Notices"</b></a>
<br>This section is intended to allow Contributors to provide
additional value-added services as long as they take the appropriate
precautions to protect other Contributors from liability associated
with such services.


<p><a name="Distribution_of_Executable_Versions"><b>"Distribution of Executable Versions"</b></a>
<br>The goal of the NPL is to encourage as much innovation as possible.
We anticipate that people will take the code licensed under the NPL and
combine it with code developed or licensed under other terms.  We also
anticipate that the combined code will be licensed under a variety of
terms, including different payment terms, support terms and use
restrictions.  Netscape does not wish to dictate the terms under which
any such executables will be available.  The NPL is designed to make
sure that the Source Code Modifications are freely available.  After
that, the creator of a larger work is free to license the executable of
the work as he or she sees fit.


<p><a name="Due_to_Law_or_Regulation"><b>"Due to Law or Regulation"</b></a>
<br>This section was included so that the license could allow for the
inclusion in the Source Code of regulated software such as cryptographic
code which may have legal restrictions placed on its broad and public
distribution.


<p><a name="Other_Products"><b>"Other Products"</b></a>
<br>This is included because some of the code (e.g. JavaScript) in the
Mozilla Communicator code is shared between Netscape client products and
other Netscape products (e.g. servers).  This code will be modified,
often times by Netscape itself, and this clause gives Netscape the right
to continue to use the original code along with modifications in our
other products without those products being affected by the license.


<p><a name="Alternative_Licensing"><b>"Alternative Licensing"</b></a>
<br>This is included for two reasons.  First, Netscape already has
certain source code licenses in place whose terms differ from those of
this NPL.  These licenses may not require the license back of code,
although in many cases such licensees do return code voluntarily.
Secondly, Netscape's goal is to make the Communicator code a widely
available as possible. Netscape believes that this License should meet
the needs of the vast majority of developers.  We anticipate that some
developers will not be willing or able to use Communicator code under
the terms of the NPL.  This provision allows us to bring as many
developers as possible into the Communicator program and maximize the
adoption of Communicator technology.

<p>However, we also felt that Netscape should not have complete freedom
in this regard.  Over time, more and more code in the source will be
code created by people outside of Netscape.  Therefore, it would be
inappropriate to allow Netscape to pick modifications and license them
freely under other terms.  We have tried to strike a balance between
the business needs of Netscape as a commercial entity and fairness to
other contributors.

<p>The NPL allows Netscape to license modifications under terms other
than the NPL only as part of a source code license for a
Netscape-branded product.  So to make use of this provision, Netscape
must take a release from the Source Code, make a Netscape-branded
product, and license that product.  Netscape cannot simply make a
business out of licensing modifications under non-NPL terms.


<p><a name="By_Initial_Developer"><b>"By Initial Developer"</b></a>
<br>We realize that we are not perfect and may not have thought of all
possible contentious situations that may arise because of this License.
This clause give us the opportunity to address problems that may arise
in the future.


<p><a name="For_New_Code"><b>"For New Code"</b></a>
<br>We added this because we want others to use this 
<nobr>NPL --</nobr> if <nobr>appropriate --</nobr> for their own forays
into open source development.  We also felt that we should allow others
to use this NPL as a basis for a similar license agreement for placing
additional code into the open software community.  (Of course, a
license agreement written by anyone other than Netscape can't affect
rights to the Mozilla Communicator code, or any Modifications created
under this NPL.)


<p><a name="Required_Legalese"><b>Required Legalese</b></a>
<br>These last sections of the License are the inevitable legal statements.
Where they are in CAPS, we are not shouting, but are required to write
these sections in capital letters by law.

<p><a name="Responsibility_for_Intellectual_Property_Claims">
<b>"Responsibility for Intellectual Property Claims"</b>
<br>The issue here is what to do about intellectual property claims,
such as patents, made by non-contributors.  Input from those with patent
expertise would be especially welcome.
