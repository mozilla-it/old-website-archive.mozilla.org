<b>2.1. The Initial Developer Grant.</b><br>

    The Initial Developer hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free,
    non-exclusive license, subject to third party intellectual property
    claims, to:

    <ul>
<p><b>(a)</b> use, reproduce, modify, display, perform, sublicense
      and distribute the Original Code with or without Modifications,
      or as part of a Larger Work; and

      <p><b>(b)</b> under by patents now or hereafter owned or
      controlled by Initial Developer, to make, have made, use and sell
      the Original Code, but solely to the extent that any such patent
      is reasonably necessary to enable You to use the Original Code on
      a stand-alone basis.

    </p></p></ul>
<p><b>2.2 Contributor Grant.</b><br>

    Each Contributor hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free

      controlled by Contributor, to make, have made, use and sell the
      Contributor Version, but solely to the extent that any such
      patent is reasonably necessary to enable You to use the
      Contributor Version on a stand-alone basis.

    </p></p></ul>
</br></p></br></ul>
<b>3. Distribution Obligations.</b>
<ul>
<b>3.1. Application of License.</b><br>

    The Modifications which You create or to which You contribute are
    governed by the terms of this License, including without limitation
    Section <b>2.2</b>.  The Source Code version of Covered Code may be
    distributed only under the terms of this License or a future
    version of this License released under Section <b>6</b>, and You must
    include a copy of this License with every copy of the Source Code
    You distribute. You may not offer or impose any terms on any Source
    Code version that alters or restricts this License or the
    recipients' rights hereunder. However, You may include an
    additional document offering the additional rights described in
    Section <b>3.5</b>.

    <p><b>3.2. Availability of Source Code.</b><br>

    Any Modification which You create or to which You contribute must
    be made available in Source Code form under the terms of this
    License either on the same media as the Executable version or via
    an accepted Electronic Distribution Mechanism to anyone to whom you
    made an Executable version available; and if made available via
    Electronic Distribution Mechanism, must remain available for at
    least twelve (12) months after the date it initially became
    available, or at least six (6) months after a subsequent version of
    that particular Modification has been made available to such
    recipients. You are responsible for ensuring that the Source Code
    version remains available even if the Electronic Distribution
    Mechanism is maintained by a third party.

    <p><b>3.3. Description of Modifications.</b><br>

    You must cause each Covered Code to which you contribute to contain
    a file documenting the changes You made to create that Covered Code
    and the date of any change. You must include, in <b>(a)</b> the
    Source Code, and <b>(b)</b> in any notice in an Executable version
    or related documentation in which You describe the origin or
    ownership of the Covered Code, a prominent statement that the
    Modification is derived, directly or indirectly, from Original Code
    provided by the Initial Developer and including the name of the
    Initial Developer.

    <p><b>3.4. Intellectual Property Matters</b>
<ul>
<p><b>(a) Third Party Claims</b>.<br>

        You will not include functionality or code in any Covered Code
        unless you have a good faith belief that such functionality or
        code does not infringe any third party rights, and shall take
        appropriate actions to remedy the situation if that good-faith
        believe subsequently changes. 

        <p> If You have knowledge that a party claims an intellectual
        property right in particular functionality or code (or its use
        under this License), you must include a file with the source
        code distribution titled ``LEGAL'' which describes the claim
        and the party making the claim in sufficient detail that a
        recipient will know whom to contact.

        <p> If you obtain such knowledge after You make Your
        Modification available as described in Section 3.2, You shall
        promptly modify the LEGAL file in all copies.  You make
        available thereafter and shall take other steps (such as
        notifying appropriate mailing lists or newsgroups) reasonably
        calculated to inform someone receiving the Covered Work that
        new knowledge has been obtained.

	<p><b>(b) Contributor APIs</b>.<br>

        If Your Modification is an application programming interface
        and You own or control patents which are reasonably necessary
        to implement that API, you must also include this information
        in the LEGAL file.

    </br></p></p></p></br></p></ul>
<p><b>3.5. Required Notices.</b><br>

    You must duplicate the notice in <b>Attachment A</b> in the Source
    Code, and this License in any documentation for the Source Code,
    where You describe recipients' rights relating to Covered Code. You
    may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support,
    indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of
    Covered Code. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and
    not on behalf of the Initial Developer or any Contributor.  You
    must make it absolutely clear than any such warranty, support,
    indemnity or liability obligation is offered by You alone, and You
    hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every
    Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or
    such Contributor as a result of warranty, support, indemnity or
    liability terms You offer.

    <p><b>3.6. Distribution of Executable Versions.</b><br>

    You may distribute Covered Code in Executable form only if the
    requirements of Section <b>3</b> have been met for that Covered
    Code, and if You include a notice stating that the Source Code
    version of the Covered Code is available under the terms of this
    License, including a description of how and where You have
    fulfilled the obligations of Section <b>3.2</b>. The notice must be
    conspicuously included in the documentation and Executable
    versions, and in each location in which You describe recipients'
    rights relating to the Covered Code. 

    <p> You may distribute the Executable version of Covered Code under
    a license of Your choice, which may contain terms different from
    this License, provided that You are in compliance with the terms of
    this License and that the license for the Executable version does
    not attempt to limit or alter the recipients rights in the Source
    Code version from the rights set forth in this License. If You
    distribute the Executable version under a different license You
    must make it absolutely clear than any terms which differ from this
    License are offered by You alone, not by the Initial Developer or
    any Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial
    Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the
    Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of any such terms
    You offer.

    <p><b>3.7. Larger Works.</b><br>

    You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Code with other
    code not governed by the terms of this License and distribute the
    Larger Work as a single product. In such a case, You must make sure
    the requirements of this License are fulfilled for the Covered
    Code.

</br></p></p></br></p></br></p></p></br></p></br></p></br></ul>
<b>4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation.</b>
<ul>

    If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this
    License with respect to some or all of the Covered Code due to
    statute or regulation then You must: <b>(a)</b> comply with the
    terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and
    <b>(b)</b> describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such
    description must be included in the LEGAL file described in Section
    <b>3.4</b> and must be included with all distributions of the
    Source Code. Except to the extent prohibited by statute or
    regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a
    recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.

</ul>
<b>5. Application of this License.</b>
<ul>

    This License applies to code to which the creator has attached the
    notice in <b>Attachment A</b>, and to Covered Works created from that
    code.

</ul>
<b>6. Versions of the License.</b>
<ul>
<b>6.1 New Versions</b>.<br>

    Netscape Communications Corporation may publish revised and/or new
    versions of the License from time to time. Each version will be
    given a distinguishing version number.

    <p><b>6.2 Effect of New Versions</b>.<br>

    Once Covered Code has been published under a particular version of
    the License, You may always continue to use it under the terms of
    that version. You may also choose to use such Covered Code under
    the terms of any subsequent version of the License published by
    Netscape. No one other than Netscape has the right to modify the
    terms applicable to Covered Code created under this License.

    <p><b>6.3 Derivative Works</b>.<br>

    If you modify this License in (which you may only do in order to
    apply it to code which is not already a Covered Work governed by
    this License), you must <b>(a)</b> rename Your license so that the
    phrases ``Mozilla'' or ``MPL'' do not appear anywhere in your
    license and <b>(b)</b> otherwise make it clear that your version of
    the license contains terms which differ from the Mozilla Public
    License. These rights are in addition to any other rights you may
    have as the copyright holder. Filling in the name of the Initial
    Developer and Original Code in <b>Attachment A</b> shall not of
    themselves be deemed to be modifications of this License.

</br></p></br></p></br></ul>
<b>7. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.</b>
<ul>

    THE COVERED WORKS ARE PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN ``AS IS''
    BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED,
    INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED WORKS
    ARE FREE OF DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR
    NON-INFRINGING. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE
    OF THE COVERED WORKS IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY COVERED WORK PROVE
    DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, YOU (NOT THE INITIAL DEVELOPER OR ANY
    OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING,
    REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN
    ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF ANY COVERED WORK IS
    AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.

</ul>
<b>8. TERMINATION.</b>
<ul>

    This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate
    automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to
    cure such breach within 30 days. All sublicenses to the Covered
    Code which are properly granted shall survive any termination of
    this License. Provisions which, by their nature, must remain in
    effect beyond the termination of this License shall survive.

</ul>
<b>9. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.</b>
<ul>

    UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT
    (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL THE INITIAL
    DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF A COVERED
    WORK, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO YOU OR
    ANY OTHER PERSON FOR ANY INULECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR
    CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT
    LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER
    FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR
    LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE
    POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT
    APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH
    PARTY'S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH
    LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR
    LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THAT
    EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

</ul>
<b>10. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS.</b>
<ul>

    Each Covered Code is a ``commercial item,'' as that term is defined
    in 48 C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of ``commercial computer
    software'' and ``commercial computer software documentation,'' as
    such terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995). Consistent
    with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4
    (June 1995), all U.S. Government End Users acquire Covered Code
    with only those rights set forth herein.

</ul>
<b>11. MISCELLANEOUS.</b>
<ul>

    This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject
    matter hereof and may be amended only by a writing executed by both
    parties.  If any provision of this License is held to be
    unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent
    necessary to make it enforceable.  Unless otherwise agreed in
    writing, all disputes relating to this License (excepting any
    dispute relating to intellectual property rights) shall be subject
    to final and binding arbitration, with the losing party paying all
    costs of arbitration. This License shall be governed by California
    law, excluding conflict of law provisions (except to the extent
    applicable law, if any, provides otherwise). The application of the
    United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale
    of Goods is expressly excluded.

</ul>
<b>12. RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS.</b>
<ul>

    Except in cases where a Contributor has failed to comply with
    Section 3.4, You are responsible for damages arising out of your
    making, using, and distributing Covered Works, on a pro rata basis
    in proportion to the amount of copies of Covered Works You used or
    distributed compared to the total amount of copies distributed, and
    in proportion to the profitability of Your distribution compared to
    overall profits made by distribution of Covered Works.

</ul>
<p><hr width="20%"><p>
<b>APPENDIX A.<br>
Additional Terms applicable to the Netscape Public License</br></b>
<ul>
<p><b>I. Effect. </b><br>

    These additional terms described in this Netscape Public 
    <nobr>License --</nobr> Appendix A shall apply to the Mozilla
    Communicator client code and to all Covered Works resulting from
    such code.

    <p><b>II. ``Netscape's Branded Code''</b> means Covered Netscape
    distributes and/or permits others to distribute under one or more
    trademark(s) which are controlled by the Netscape but which are not
    licensed for use under this License.

    <p><b>III. Netscape and logo.</b><br>

    This License does not grant any rights to use the trademark
    ``Netscape'', the Netscape ``N and horizon'' logo or the Netscape
    lighthouse logo, even if such marks are included in the Original
    Code.

    <p><b>IV. Inability to Comply Due to Contractual Obligation.</b><br>

    Prior to licensing the Original Code under this License, Netscape
    has licensed third party code for use in Netscape's Branded
    Code. To the extent that Netscape is limited contractually from
    making such third party code available under this License, Netscape
    may choose to reintegrate such code into Covered Code without being
    required to distribute such code in Source Code form, even if such
    code would otherwise be considered ``Modifications'' under this
    License.

    <p><b>V. Use of Modifications and Covered Code by Initial Developer.</b>
<ul>
<p><b>V.1. In General.</b><br>

	The obligations of Section <b>3</b> apply to Netscape, except
	to the extent specified in this <b>Attachment A</b>, Section
	<b>V.2</b> and <b>V.3</b>.

	<p><b>V.2. Other Products.</b><br>

	Netscape may include Covered Code in products other than the
	Netscape's Branded Code which are released by Netscape during
	the two (2) years following the release date of the Original
	Code, without such additional products becoming subject to the
	terms of this License, and may license such additional products
	on different terms from those contained in this License.

	<p><b>V.3. Alternative Licensing.</b><br>

	Netscape may license the Source Code of Netscape's Branded
	Code, including Modifications incorporated therein, without
	such additional products becoming subject to the terms of this
	License, and may license such additional products on different
	terms from those contained in this License.

    </br></p></br></p></br></p></ul>
<p><b>VI. Arbitration and Litigation</b>.<br>

    Any arbitration arising out of or relating to this Agreement shall
    be held in Santa Clara County, California, under the auspices of
    JAMS/EndDispute. Any litigation arising out of or relating to this
    Agreement shall be subject to the jurisdiction of the courts of
    Federal District
