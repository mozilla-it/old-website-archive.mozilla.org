<h1 id="page-title">Browsers Matter</h1>
<p>Browser software allows people to access the vast amounts of data
and computer programs on the World Wide Web. At the same time,
browsers need to facilitate interaction between that web content and
the user's computer. Therefore browsers need to implement
security mechanisms so that malicious web content does not have access
to the user's computer.
<p>The importance of good computer security is demonstrated by the
 series of recent security exploits (known as "download.ject "or
"scob"), in which vulnerabilities in Internet Explorer were used to
allow malicious computer programs to be secretly installed and executed
on machines running Internet Explorer.
<p>Browser software must include both good security design and good
security practices to maximize the amount of protection
available. No piece of browser software can provide 100%
protection, just as no set of locks and keys for our homes can be 100%
effective. But browser design and implementation can make
an enormous difference in the level of protection available to
users. In addition, management practices in the way
software problems are addressed can also dramatically affect the level
of protection consumers enjoy.

<h2>There is No "Magic Bullet"</h2>
<p>Effective computer security involves building many levels of
defense. This includes:
<ul>
<li>Product design (the "security architecture")
 <li>Good product implementation (the presence or
  absence of bugs)
 <li>Mechanisms for identifying potential problems
  (finding potential problems before they have been used to harm
  consumers)
 <li>Quick turnaround when problems have been
  verified (fixing potential problems before they have been used to harm
  consumers)
 <li>Timely creation and distribution of updated
  software
</li></li></li></li></li></ul>
<h2>Switching to Mozilla -- Mozilla Security Architecture</h2>
<p>Recent security failings in Internet Explorer have caused experts
(Including the United States Department of Homeland Security's Computer
Emergency Readiness Team) to recommend that consumers stop using
Internet Explorer and switch to other browsers. Mozilla
Firefox and other Mozilla browsers use a
fundamentally different security architecture than does Internet
Explorer. As a result, Mozilla browsers are not affected by a
range of security problems that compromise Internet Explorer. For
more detail on exploits leading to the suggestion to switch see: <a href="http://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/713878">http://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/713878</a>
and <a href="http://secunia.com/advisories/12048/">http://secunia.com/advisories/12048/</a>.</p>
<p>The Mozilla design approach is to
provide multiple layers of defense so that if one protection mechanism
performs imperfectly, another protection mechanism (or two or three)
will act as a safety net, thus strengthening the system's ability to
defeat attacks.</p>
<p>Security benefits of Mozilla browsers include:</p>
<ol>
<li>Firefox and other Mozilla browsers do
  not allow a website to download onto, install onto, or execute code on
  a user's computer without the user's agreement.
 <li>
<p>Firefox and Mozilla
   browsers do not designate content as
   "local." An architecture that includes the concept of "local" content
   and then gives such content upgraded security permissions and allows it
   greater access to the user's machines, means that content which is
   mistakenly treated as local has vastly more potential to do damage.
   Indeed we saw this type of problem in the
   recent Internet Explorer vulnerabilities, in which malicious content was
   secretly sent to users machines, managed to
   falsely identify itself as "local" content to Internet Explorer, was
   then granted enhanced access to machines running Internet Explorer, and
   used that access to install a program which logged keystrokes, including credit card numbers.
   Mozilla users were not affected. A more detailed description can be
   found at: <a href="http://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/713878">http://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/713878</a>.</p>
<p>It should be noted that these security
   policies can result in some loss of convenience to the user. We all
   make these trade-offs in many areas of life. For example, needing
   a key to open the front door of our homes means we all have to get
   keys, find them in the morning and make sure not to lose them during
   the day, which is far less convenient than leaving the door
   unlocked. Most of us choose to trade the inconvenience of
   locks on our front door for the greater security this provides. For
   users who want increased security, Mozilla browsers are a great
   choice.
 <li>
<p>Internet Explorer uses a
   technology known as ActiveX. ActiveX, particularly in combination
   with the "local" concept described above, has been very fertile
   ground for those designing security exploits. Here's how Slate
   summarized the problem with Active X (see <a href="http://slate.msn.com/id/2103152">http://slate.msn.com/id/2103152</a>
   for the complete article):
  <blockquote>
<p>The problem is
    that hackers continue to find and exploit security holes in Explorer.
    Many of them take advantage of Explorer's ActiveX system, which lets
    Web sites download and install software onto visitors' computers,
    sometimes without users' knowledge. ActiveX was meant to make it easy
    to add the latest interactive multimedia and other features to sites,
    but instead it's become a tool for sneaking spyware onto unsuspecting
    PCs.
  </p></blockquote>
<li>Mozilla browsers maintain a
  separation between the application and the operating system. IE
  browsing functionality is becoming increasingly integrated into Windows; a security problem in
  browsing functionality may therefore affect services which are shared with, or
  relied on by, other parts of the operating system. This makes a
  multi-layered defensive strategy complex to design and implement
  effectively. The convergence of Internet Explorer and the Windows
  operating system has provided fertile ground for malicious programmers.
</li></p></li></p></li></li></ol>
<h2>Switching to Mozilla -- Managing the Project for Consumer
Security </h2>
<p>As noted above, it's virtually impossible to provide a web
browser that is absolutely secure against all possible attacks.
Effective security also requires focused attention to early
identification and effective resolution of potential problems.
Complacency or a "business as usual" attitude regarding security issues
does not serve the consumer well.
<p>Finding potential security holes is tricky and requires people with
expertise and focus. The Mozilla project has developed a
community of people who are passionate about computer security and put
the protection of consumers and their data above business and revenue
considerations. We value this community highly and actively
encourage their involvement. We are now providing a "<a href="https://www.mozilla.org/press/mozilla-2004-08-02.html">bounty</a>"
to those who find and report potentially serious security flaws, to
encourage security experts to help improve Mozilla products. This
community promotes the identification of potential problems before
exploits are developed and before consumers suffer.</p>
<p>Once a security hole has been identified and verified, it is often
possible to develop a fix for Mozilla products very quickly. It's
a bit counter-intuitive, but fixing the problem in Mozilla
browsers is often easier than finding it in the first
place. Developing fixes may be more complex for browsers
which are deeply integrated into, and thus share services with, the
operating system because fixing the problem could affect aspects of the
operation system that rely on the browser. After a fix is created
it needs to be tested. Then the new version of the software needs
to be distributed to the public, and the public encouraged to upgrade
to the new software. </p>
<p>These activities can be very inconvenient to the software
developer. They are time-consuming and disruptive. They
require software vendors to place user protection above business
convenience and predetermined release cycles. </p>
<p>The Mozilla project has shown strength
in this regard. For example, we
recently completed the entire process in just under 36 hours
in order to make sure that we had a fix ready and updated products
available as soon as the exploit became known to the
public. We proactively informed our users of the problem and
provided a choice of mechanisms to encourage users to upgrade
immediately.
<p>We take these actions because we do not believe that a "business as
usual" attitude about security is appropriate. We have also
created <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/projects/security/security-bugs-policy.html">a
system of checks and balances</a> to guard against complacency. </p>
<p>The set of experts who care about security are not all employees of
the Mozilla Foundation. They participate in the open source
Mozilla project because they care passionately about security, and
because they want a browser that meets their security standards.
These participants aren't very concerned about the inconvenience
or difficulties involved in releasing improved software. This
group represents the voice of the consumer very effectively, and helps
ensure that the Mozilla project continues to make protection for our
users a high priority.</p>
<h2>Browsers Matter. A Lot.</h2>
<p>Recent security exploits affecting Internet Explorer make it clear
how critical good security practices are to protecting consumers.
</p>
<p>Are the Mozilla products perfect? No. </p>
<p>Are we passionate about security? Yes. </p>
<p>Do Mozilla users avoid a range of security problems that affect IE
users? Yes, see the links above for examples.</p>
