  I spent the better part of the day at Roosevelt High School with a Reconnective Healer named Lenzy Stuart who actually taught me to play basketball when we attended RHS, together.<br />
<br />
I picked him up in the morning and we spent all morning in the Japanese Garden where we saw and spoke to people about the role that Lenzy played for over 2 years as the campus healer. We discovered that he had been missed and this visit has started his return to the school for a new school year. Teachers and several of the sports teams scheduled for him to setup is table in the weight room.<br />
<br />
The Japanese Garden is a special place which was re-created initially by the students in the early 1990&#039;s in an effort to commemorate the original RHS Japanese Garden from the mid 1930&#039;s.which was destroyed during because of the war with Japan. Another alumni Bruce Kaji who founded the Japanese American National Museum of LA came along and raised funds to upgrade the garden in 1996.  Then Shideo Takayama, president of the Japanese Club from the 30&#039;s who created the initial RHS Japanese Garden visited from Japan in 2003 for the first time since he graduated in the 30&#039;s. He financed yet another renovation and upgrade to the garden including adding the upper and lower ponds <br />
<br />
I also spent time talking to the Health Teacher who both Lenzy and I worked with on the first annual school health fair in 2008. Title 1 coordinator asked me to help with the school website http://rooseveltlausd.org    <a href='http://caltek.net:8000/pa/album?album_id=171671' class='more'>Related Link</a>

  One of my employers asked me for help. He told me he was a active member of the catholic church in Mar del Plata, Argentina, promoting religion to young adults. He nedded a website to make the relationship between people and church easier and more friendly, but nobody wanted to do it for free.<br />
I said &quot;Ok, lets do it&quot;. Ive made some developing for the same project in the past but they put the project on hold. So actually the plan was to finished what we started before.<br />
So i used the Mozilla Service Week to finish the project. I include some new code that ive learned this year, made the backend panel so they can manage the content themselves.<br />
i am glad to contribute.<br />

the site is www.pastoralvocacional.com.ar but the ftp is not accesible yet, so temporally the site is being hosted here (please note that all the info is &quot;Lorem ipsum&quot; yet.<br />

  Over the last year and a half, I&rsquo;ve been working on a project called Curiosity Clubhouse that uses computers, both in the classroom and at home, to help kindergarten students learn. It&rsquo;s a web-based system that uses a collection of flash-based learning activities to help kids learn their letters and numbers and get started learning to read.<br />
<br />
It came about after some conversations with an extraordinary kindergarten teacher named Barbara Brisson. One of the most technology-savvy teachers I&rsquo;ve ever encountered, she was able to put her finger on a number of issues that limited the utility of computers in the kindergarten classroom. <br />
<br />
Not the least of these is that the address bar in the browser is very hard for non-readers to use.   And think about how to build a login page for someone who doesn&#039;t yet know the alphabet.<br />
<br />
Curiosity Clubhouse, our experiment in the web for pre-readers has solved many these problems and added additional capabilities that have resulted in improved end-of-year reading and math scores for Barbara&rsquo;s kindergartners. <br />

It\u2019s a web-based system that uses a collection of flash-based learning activities to help kids learn their letters and numbers and get started learning to read.\n\nIt came about after some conversations with an extraordinary kindergarten teacher named Barbara Brisson. One of the most technology-savvy teachers I\u2019ve ever encountered, she was able to put her finger on a number of issues that limited the utility of computers in the kindergarten classroom. \n\nNot the least of these is that the address bar in the browser is very hard for non-readers to use.   And think about how to build a login page for someone who doesn't yet know the alphabet.\n\nCuriosity Clubhouse, our experiment in the web for pre-readers has solved many these problems and added additional capabilities that have resulted in improved end-of-year reading and math scores for Barbara\u2019s kindergartners. \n\nFor more information on the Curiosity Clubhouse project follow the","content":"http:\/\/farm4.static.flickr.com\/3604\/3568949516_2846ba3188_m.jpg"}             , {button:true} );

    <p class='story-description'>        <span class="author">By Priya Ranjan Shrivastava</span>
    
  Please Visit at : www.orisconbiotech.com<br />
Please help  my company and suggest a solution !<br />
Although I am quite stranger to you , but I do believe that brotherhood should be practiced by all successful leader in the hour of need to another business person who wants to succeed in any adverse conditions !<br />
May I get your kind blessing in terms of Financial Bailout for my Pharmaceutical Company named ORISCON BIOTECH ( I) PRIVATE LIMITED My Company is ready to provide 12% interest per annum on the total amount of bailout package.The requirement for my company is of INR Rs. One Crore [ US $ 0.25 million ; (BritishPond - 0.15 million) ] only.<br />
My COMPANY is still in the process of generating the required fund of Rs. One Crore which is the least amount needed to launch its Fifty Branded Products after creating an all India marketing network . I have already roped in 20 hard core Marketing Professionals who are having strong potential to generate optimum sales volume at the tune of Rs. Two Crore [ US $ 0.50 million ( British Pond - 0.30 million) ] per annum that will yield a net profit of Rs. Twenty Five Lakhs for the company in the first operational year.<br />
I strongly believe in one of those statements that :&quot; Success depends upon your ability to shape the future by anticipating and responding to change according to hour of need besides you should also know that you have never been better positioned to achieve this. &quot;<br />

    <p class='story-description'>        <span class="author">By Patis Patio</span>
    
  No Work? Yes, the Greneteam put this project together with (almost) no work.Four beautiful growing gardens in 4 ft by 4 ft square units all promising fresh food for the community.The members just stood there waiting and watching, still I pushed on until Sunday two of the members brought seeds and Ellen an elder handed me $23.00 cash. I did all the research using Mozilla and came out with this idea to use your balcony/front steps /community clubs and churches to teach a simple gardening method taught by Mel the engineer from Utah. I was there in Park city painting murals for the resorts and could see the lushness of the landscapes..Historical idea to have edible landscapes. Now that I have finished this one prototype...I will do the entire neighborhood on Havendale by my Gallery.God blesses the,&quot;Doers&quot;, and I&#039;m not one to be stopped. I did this in honor of my son, Eric Mills, that passed away in Feb 2009.<br />
This was our first church when he was young boy. <br />
Join me with the Greneteam...The Ideas are all over the internet that can help people in these trying times.
