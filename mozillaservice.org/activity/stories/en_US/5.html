  The Abriendo Mentes (Opening Minds) project is a community-based literacy project with the mission to enhance literacy by providing experiential learning programs,creative arts instruction, and access to educational resources to rural Latin American communities. Since we are currently in the start up phase, our biggest challenge is to develop the online presence, marketing, and fund raising skills to ensure this program will expand and be sustainable. We specifically need assistance from volunteers with technical skills and fresh ideas to work with website and logo design, and marketing. <br />
Our pilot project is located in Playa Potrero, which is a small village of a few hundred people on the Pacific coast in the Guanacaste province of Costa Rica. The community school can only provide limited classes through the elementary level, thus steady learning and continuing education is a great challenge for this community and other rural Latin American villages. We provide afternoon English instruction incorporated with creative art activities and critical thinking skills to expand upon concepts taught in school. To further supplement our program, we take experiential learning field trips for real life application of the English language. We see our program as more than an operation to increase the English skills of rural communities, but rather as a way to increase self esteem, stimulate developing minds, and increase the overall literacy skills of the world.

  My name is Johan Hilding, I live in Sweden where I study Computer Science at Kungliga Tekniska H&ouml;gskolan.<br />
<br />
Mifos is an open source web-based management information system (MIS) that provides a great operational efficiency and robust real-time business intelligence enabling Microfinance institutions to broaden the scale and impact of financial services to the poor.<br />
<br />
I found out about Mifos through the Google Summer of Code, where I applied to help with writing acceptance tests. <br />
<br />
I got accepted, so I&#039;ve spent this summer adding acceptance tests for the Mifos application.<br />
<br />
The thing that I like the most about working with Mifos is that the community is alive and very helpful. It&#039;s also very well documented and well structured.<br />

  DC is a hungry city. Half of the children in our nation&#039;s capital are at risk of hunger. We suffer from limited access to nutritious food, high rates of obesity and diet-related illnesses like diabetes. It doesn&#039;t have to be this way. Indeed, we can find a number of new efforts to increase access to fresh and affordable food in DC&#039;s low-income communities &ndash; from gleaning operations, to food stamps at farmers&#039; markets, to a nascent urban gardening scene, to innovative web applications like the DC Food Finder. [http://dcfoodfinder.org] A movement is happening, and we&rsquo;re going to build it a space of its very own. As part of the Healthy and Affordable Food For All Coalition, we&#039;re planning to launch a collaborative blog about local food security, called the DC Food For All.<br />

It&#039;s an exciting project and your expertise with Wordpress and/or design could make it come alive. CONTACT ME at ***@***.*** to get involved.  <a href='http://dcfoodfinder.org/' class='more'>Related Link</a>

  Bread for the City is a non-profit organization that provides comprehensive assistance to DC&#039;s poorest residents. At our blog (http://breadforthecity.blogspot.com) we write daily about the problems of poverty and potential solutions to it.<br />
<br />
We want to bring our blog (currently on a separate platform) into the infrastructure of our website (www.breadforthecity.org) despite the fact that our platform (Blackbaud Netcommunity) doesn&#039;t really &#039;get&#039; how blogs work. So we&#039;re going to build a wordpress site that will mimic our official site. We have a trusty volunteer who will drive this project on the back-end, and are looking for additional muscle to make it a reality on the front-end.<br />
<br />
We get things done. (Check our www.SaveOurSafetyNet.com, which we built in two days!) We can put you to good use, and you will be servicing the poor.   <a href='http://breadforthecity.blogspot.com' class='more'>Related Link</a>

  Barakat&rsquo;s mission is to improve the well-being of marginalized groups in South and Central Asia by increasing access to quality education and a healthy environment.<br />
<br />
Barakat works towards this mission by supporting local, innovative organizations that are making a real difference in the places they work. We establish a close, long-lasting relationship with each of our partners. These relationships allow our partners to focus their energies on helping more people and making their programs more effective. Barakat strives to make the maximum impact possible with each dollar, so we have high standards for our partnerships.<br />
<br />
What makes us different?<br />
We work in places that are difficult to access, and often support changes that challenge the status quo. We educate girls and women in places where girls&rsquo; education is discouraged. We support environmental rehabilitation in places where land is seen as something to exploit. We find ways to work health into our schools in places where policies forbid such work. We see challenges and obstacles as a reason to try harder, not a reason to give up.<br />
<br />
With out local office located in Central Square, Cambridge, we need the help of an IT specialist. The aid of a specialist will help to boost our overall production in the office. Our office uses Mac/Apple OSX computers. <br />
<br />
Please contact Chelsea Stine at ***@***.*** if you are interested in helping us out during Service week, or any other time.<br />
<br />
Many thanks!<br />
