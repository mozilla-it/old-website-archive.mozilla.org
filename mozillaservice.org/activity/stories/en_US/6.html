    <p class='story-description'>        <span class="author">By Elizabeth LaCroix</span>
    
  Asylum Access is a non-profit that helps refugees assert their rights to live safely, work, put kids in school and access healthcare and social services within their first countries of refuge.  Through legal aid, strategic litigation, policy advocacy and community education, Asylum Access empowers refugees in Africa, Asia and Latin America to assert their human rights. <br />
<br />
Asylum Access strives to assist as many refugees as possible with a limited amount of resources. One of the innovative ways that Asylum Access seeks to accomplish this goal is through the development of a chatline.  The Asylum Access chatline will connect U.S.-based attorneys to refugees around the world in order to provide free legal aid to those in need.  Using innovative technology, the chatline will enable refugees, who could not otherwise obtain legal advice, to access information and legal services that would allow them to successfully pursue their right to asylum. <br />
<br />
If you have any experience in chatline or web design and are interested in helping us with this project, please join us for Mozilla Service Week. If you can help, contact Caroline Swindells at ***@***.*** Thank you!<br />

  Being resourceful has been a must to get Baby&#039;s First Home (a transitional living shelter for homeless teen mothers in NYC) off the ground. With no money and high expectations, we&#039;ve had to figure out how to do a lot with a little. And that is how we ended up with a website designed entirely in Flash by someone (me) who doesn&#039;t actually know how to program at all.<br />
<br />
The site actually looks pretty good, but since I don&#039;t have any formal knowledge about this stuff, every time I want to add a new feature (scrolling panes, submission forms) it&#039;s like wrestling with a crocodile. We need your help!<br />
<br />
We&#039;re looking for someone who can convert my behind-the-scenes jerryrigging into a website with a similar feel, but a more conventional (preferably html based) underlying code. Ideally we&#039;d love someone who would be interested in sticking around as our web guru longer-term, but even a one-shot rebuild that we could then pass onto someone else to maintain would be truly phenomenal.<br />
<br />
Please check out our website and if it catches your eye don&#039;t hesitate to get in touch!<br />

    <p class='story-description'>        <span class="author">By Miriam Gillow-Wiles</span>
    
  The Western Hardrock Watershed Team (WHWT) is a coalition of community/watershed-improvement groups, confronting the challenges that remain from historic mining in the West. We address environmental degradation and community impoverishment by providing rural mining communities with the skills and capacity they need to make their neighborhoods, communities, and watersheds better places to live and work.<br />
<br />
The WHWT provides important capacity-building support to rural mining communities through an innovative partnership between the Office of Surface Mining (OSM) and AmeriCorps*VISTA (Volunteers in Service to America) - often referred to as the domestic Peace Corps. We help build capacity, sustainability, and environmental awareness by placing OSM/VISTAs with local community watershed groups throughout Colorado, New Mexico, and Montana.<br />
<br />
All our OSM/VISTAs are college graduates, passionate, and willing to live at poverty for a year or two to make effective and lasting change. We come from all different walks of life. We vary in age from mid 50s to early 20s and have bachelors and masters degrees ranging from Religious Studies to Geology. Some of us are locals, some have moved thousands of miles from home for this opportunity. What ties us together is the belief that we can undo the environmental and economic damage and thus break the cycle of rural poverty, as well as a strong desire to change the world, one small piece at a time.  <a href='http://www.hardrockteam.org' class='more'>Related Link</a>

      class="heading-link">Creating Connections for Confidential Communication</a></h2>
    <p class='story-description'>        <span class="author">By Alyssa Ford Morel</span>
    
  Pathway Homes is a non-profit in Northern Virginia providing non-time-limited housing and support to more than 350 homeless and other adults with mental illness. We are faced with an urgent need to develop a method of communicating with our staff at approximately 30 remote locations in a confidential, HIPAA- compliant manner. We need to securely transmit confidential:<br />
 - Email<br />
 - Clinical records<br />
 - Accounting records<br />
 - Personnel documents such as timesheets, reimbursement forms, etc.<br />
 - Other sensitive administrative documents.<br />
<br />
We believe we need some type of virtual private network and intranet which would allow users to log into our central server allowing access or sharing of files and data. A content management/version control such as SharePoint would be very useful. We are looking for a volunteer with expertise to assess, develop and implement this crucial agency-wide tool.<br />
<br />
Helpful information: Pathway Homes currently uses Dell servers with Intel-based processors operating on 32-bit architecture at the administrative location. The workstations are 75 percent Dell and 25 percent other name-brand hardware. Remote locations currently do not connect to the main servers. Staff members at the administrative location share files via a series of network drives. We have no dedicated IT personnel or budget for this project. We do not have an intranet site.  <a href='http://pathwayhomes.org' class='more'>Related Link</a>
