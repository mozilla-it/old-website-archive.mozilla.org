  For almost 40 years, People&#039;s Community Health Centers has provided solid, dependable health care to people in Baltimore, regardless of their insurance status or their ability to pay. We believe that everyone&#039;s entitled to quality medical care.<br />
<br />
We get decent enough traffic on our Wordpress-based blog/web site. But we&#039;re a long way from being as solid a web presence as we are a medical presence. We need help connected our disconnected web site. Things like smooth e-donation and volunteer info. Things like video capabilities and blogging capabilities for our doctors and nurses. Things that can put our visitors right next to us on the front lines of the fight for health care and against poverty.<br />
<br />
We&#039;re also behind the curve when it comes to social media. Sure, we have a modest Facebook presence. But we could do so much more. With a little help and guidance from someone with some experience, we could use social media to tell our story to donors, to patients, to funding sources and to government and private influencers. <br />
<br />
We have a committed staff. We have great doctors and nurses. We have great patients and we have inspirational stories. And we know how to tell them. But we need help with new WAYS of telling them.<br />
<br />

  Ragging (Hazing) is a serious menace in India. Every year about 10 &quot;ragging-deaths&quot; get reported, while hundreds of students get badly injured and/or disabled. COUNTLESS of innocent teenagers suffer extreme forms of brutal abuses for several months!!!<br />
<br />
In its long presence, ragging has ruined countless of innocent lives and careers.<br />
<br />
Society Against Violence in Education (SAVE) is possibly the first registered non-profit organization in India dedicated to address this issue.<br />
<br />
SAVE was conceptualized by young professionals and students from diverse academic fields. It has been working mainly in the following areas -<br />
<br />
(i) Spreasing the awareness.<br />
(ii) Providing medical, legal and counseling supports to the victims,<br />
(iii) Promoting Anti-Ragging units within campuses to render the campus environments hostile to &quot;ragging&quot;.<br />
<br />
We are in dire need of tech helps, mostly for the following areas -<br />
<br />
(i) Upgradation of our website.<br />
(ii) Use of social-networking or other tools to increase volunteer / support base.<br />
(iii) Publishing eNewsletters.<br />
(iv) Getting online supports.<br />
<br />
Several media have published articles on our activities.<br />
<br />
We shall be highly thankful, if we may get the necessary help for our cause.<br />
