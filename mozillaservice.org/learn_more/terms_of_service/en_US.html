<h2>May 2009</h2>

<p class="intro">If you volunteer to provide a service with a Mozilla partner by means of the Mozilla Service Week sponsored by Mozilla Corporation (&quot;<strong>Mozilla</strong>&quot;) via the <a href='../../index.html'>Mozilla Service Program website</a>, you are subject to the following terms, as well as Mozilla's Privacy Policy, <a href="http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/about/legal.html">web site notices</a> and other policies, guidelines or requirements that may be posted on an Mozilla Service Program web site (the &quot;Terms&quot;).  By acting as a volunteer, you agree to these Terms.  If you are an individual acting as a representative of a corporation or other legal entity that wishes to volunteer any services, you represent and agree that you accept the Terms on behalf of such entity.  If you have any questions about these terms or the Mozilla Service Program, please email: <a href='mailto:mozservice@mozilla.org '>mozservice@mozilla.org </a> (the &quot;Website&quot;).  If you do not understand, or do not agree to be bound or to abide by these Terms, please do not volunteer during the Mozilla Service Program website.</p>
<ol>

<li><strong>General</strong>
<p>Mozilla is providing a service linking non-profit organizations with potential volunteers from its large community.  Mozilla is not responsible, nor will it be held liable, for the actions of its volunteers or the actions of its Service Program partners.</p>
<p>Mozilla may in its sole discretion change, modify, suspend, make improvements to, or discontinue any aspect of the Mozilla Service Program temporarily or permanently, at any time and without notice to you.  Under no circumstance will Mozilla be liable for any such change, modification, suspension, improvement or discontinuance.</p>
<p>Mozilla reserves the right to change these Terms at any time by posting a new Terms of Service on this website.</li>
<li><strong>Volunteer Registration</strong>
<p>To become a volunteer, please visit and register with the non-profit organization of your choice.   Please review that organization's terms of service and privacy policies.  Each organization's policies are different and it determines its own privacy policy for the distribution and use of personal information.  If you are concerned about how an organization will use this information, check out its privacy policy. By registering to become a volunteer, you represent and warrant that the information you provide during the registration process is accurate.  Mozilla may use the information that you provide to Mozilla during the registration process, in particular your email address to communicate with you about the Mozilla Service Program or, at your election, to send you additional information about Mozilla.  Other than the information requested during your registration, Mozilla will never ask you for any personally-identifying information.  If anyone asks you for such information, do not give it to them especially if they claim to be from Mozilla.</p></li>
<li><strong>Personal Information on a Public Forum</strong>
<p>When you contribute to a public area such as an open forum on the internet, the information that you submit will be made available to the general public.  For this reason, we recommend that you do not submit any sensitive information, including your full name, home address, telephone number, or other information that would enable other users or anyone reading this Website to locate you. </p></li>
<li><strong>User Representations and Warranties.</strong>
<p>You are entirely responsible for the content of anything you post on the Website (collectively, &quot;<strong>Post</strong>&quot;).  When you make a Post, you thereby represent and warrant that:(a) the distribution, transmission, public display and performance, accessing, downloading and copying of your Post does not and will not infringe the copyright, trademark or trade secret rights of any third party; (b) your Post does not contain any viruses, worms, Trojan horses, malicious code or other harmful or destructive content; (c) your Post is not obscene, lewd, lascivious, filthy, excessively violent, harassing or otherwise objectionable, libelous or slanderous, does not incite, encourage or threaten immediate physical harm against another, does not violate any applicable law, regulation, or rule, and does not violate the privacy or publicity rights of any third party; (d) your Post does not amount to trolling, or the making of controversial statements for the sole purpose of generating responses by others; and (e) your Post does not inundate the Website with communications or other traffic suggesting no serious intent to use the Website for its stated purpose.</p>
<p>Mozilla has the right (though not the obligation) in its sole discretion to delete any Posts that violate any Mozilla policy, are in any way harmful or objectionable, or are excessive in size.</p></li>
<li><strong>Mozilla's Right to Manage the Website and Terminate Users.</strong>
  <ol>
    <li><p><strong>Mozilla Website Management.</strong>
Mozilla reserves the right but does not have the obligation to:  (a) monitor the Website for violations of these Terms; (b) in Mozilla's sole discretion and without limitation, delete any User's Post or any portion thereof that may violate these Terms or any Mozilla policy; and (c) to otherwise manage the Website in a manner designed to protect the rights and property of Mozilla and others and to facilitate the proper functioning of the Website.</p></li>
    <li><p><strong>Mozillas Right to Terminate Users.</strong> Without limiting any other provision of these Terms, Mozilla reserves the right to, in Mozilla's sole discretion and without notice or liability deny access to and use of the website to any person, for any reason or for no reason at all, including without limitation for breach of any representation, warranty or covenant contained in these Terms, or of any applicable law or regulation.</p></li>
  </ol>
</li>
<li><strong>Term.</strong>
<p>These Terms shall remain in full force and effect while you use the Website. Mozilla may terminate your use or participation at any time, without warning.</p></li>
<li><strong>Third Party Websites.</strong>
<p>Mozilla has not reviewed, and cannot review, all of the material, including computer software, made available through the websites and webpages to which the Website links, and that link to the Website. Mozilla does not have any control over those non-Mozilla websites and webpages, and is not responsible for their contents or their use. By linking to a non-Mozilla website or webpage, Mozilla does not represent or imply that it endorses such website or webpage. Mozilla disclaims any responsibility for any harm resulting from your use of non-Mozilla websites and webpages.</p></li>
<li><strong>Limitation of Liability.</strong>
<p>UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES WILL MOZILLA BE LIABLE TO YOU OR TO ANY NON-PROFIT ORGANIZATION FOR WHICH YOU VOLUNTEER FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, SPECIAL OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH YOUR SERVICES INCURRED BY YOU HOWEVER CAUSED AND UNDER ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY.  This shall include, but not be limited to, any loss of profit (whether incurred directly or indirectly), any loss of goodwill or business reputation, any loss of data suffered, cost of procurement of substitute goods, or other intangible loss, for any permanent or temporary cessation in the provision of the Mozilla Services Program, or the deletion of, corruption of, or failure to store, any content and other communications data maintained or transmitted by or through your volunteer services; whether or not Mozilla has been advised of the possibility of such damages. UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES SHALL MOZILLA BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR ANY AMOUNT. Some states do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or consequential damages, so only the limitations that are lawful in your jurisdiction will apply to you and our liability will be limited to the maximum extent permitted by law.</p></li>
<li><strong>Indemnity.</strong> 
<p>You agree to indemnify and hold Mozilla, its parent, subsidiaries, directors, employees, contractors, licensors, contributors, and affiliates, and their respective directors, officers, agents, partners and employees, harmless from any loss, liability, claim, or demand, including reasonable attorneys' fees, made by any third party due to or arising out of your volunteer services, Posts, and use of the Website, and/or arising from a breach of these Terms and/or any breach of your representations and warranties set forth above and/or if any Post stored on Mozilla's servers causes Mozilla to be liable to another.</p></li> 
<li><strong>Other.</strong> 
<p>These Terms are governed by the laws of the state of California, U.S.A., excluding its conflict of law provisions. If any portion of these Terms is held to be invalid or unenforceable, the remaining portions will remain in full force and effect. In the event of a conflict between a translated version of these Terms and the English language version, the English language version shall control.  Mozilla's subsidiaries and affiliates shall be third party beneficiaries of these Terms, entitled to enforce and rely upon the provisions hereof.</p></li>
