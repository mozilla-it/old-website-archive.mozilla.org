This repository is for the Mozilla Website Archive, which will store websites that are no longer active but have a historical significance within the Mozilla community.  Sites that have become inactive or no longer serve the Mozilla mission may be scraped and archived in the MWA, after which the full sites may be taken down.  Visitors to the retired sites will be forwarded to the archived version of the site.

Each archived site will be available through its domain name.  For example, Mozilla Service Week had the domain name mozillaservice.org.  This archived site will be available at http://website-archive.mozilla.org/mozillaservice.org.

The Mozilla Website Archive will only host html, css and js files.  It does not require SSL or any database / framework considerations.
