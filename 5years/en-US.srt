00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,800
By 2004, the Internet had become a part of everyday life.

2
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:11,500
It was a place for connecting, learning, sharing and collaborating.

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
But something wasn’t right. 

4
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:19,500
Web users wanted to explore without being spied on, preyed on, or ripped off, 

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,500
but viruses, spyware, popups and adware were everywhere.

6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:31,500
The only thing personalized about the experience was the information being gathered about users without their knowledge.

7
00:00:32,300 --> 00:00:36,500
It was time to take back the web so it could serve its original purpose: 

8
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,500
…enriching the lives of individuals. 

9
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,500
From this simple, powerful desire… came Firefox,

10
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,500
specifically built to make the web better,  

10
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,300
born of an open system 

11
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:52,800
where the design of the software could be shared, customized and improved upon…

12
00:00:52,900 --> 00:00:55,000
by anyone, anywhere, anytime.

13
00:00:56,600 --> 00:01:00,000
As word and code spread, Firefox inspired a community

14
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,000
that sees the web as a living thing that must be nurtured to grow and thrive.

15
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:12,300
People worldwide are embracing this ecology of ideas and supporting a system that’s all about their needs and interests 

16
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:19,000
and keeping the internet a vibrant, exciting place. Designed by everyone, it’s for everyone. 

17
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:22,000
Over one billion downloads later

18
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,500
it shows no signs of slowing down.

19
00:01:25,300 --> 00:01:29,000
With Firefox, life online can reflect who users really are.

20
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
From how they see it 

21
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,000
connect with it

22
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:34,400
share it

23
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:36,500
to how they grow with it.

24
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Firefox is here to help them find their own way

25
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,500
moving at the speed of their imagination.

26
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,000
We’ve come so far in just five years

27
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,000
imagine what we can do together in the next five.

28
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:52,000
Let’s keep the Internet healthy, open

29
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:55,000
and the creative fires burning bright.

29
00:01:55,700 --> 00:01:59,000
Light the world with Firefox.
