		<description>I have used Mozilla for almost as long as I have used a computer. The first thing I did when I bought my first computer was go to Mozilla&#039;s download page (back when they where running 1.6) and download Mozilla. For the doubters out there, it really does work. Several of my friends who bought computers at the same time as me, some of them much nicer machines, have manged to kill their computers with the bloated IE. Meanwhile, I am still running this old thing in prime shape! I have European friends who have attempted to use FireFox overseas with no success, but have manged to run a few Chrome builds. I also just got my school to make a major switch from the old IE 6 to the new FireFox, and general productivity has increased exponentially. For the continued spread of Mozilla everywhere!</description>

		<description>I use Firefox at home but at college I&#039;m forced to use IE and I hate it. We&#039;re not allowed to download anything and even if we do download a different browser, anything that is saved on the computer gets deleted as soon as you log out and you have to put any work you do on a memory stick. 
It annoys me that we don&#039;t get the freedom of choice at educational establishments where we are meant to open our minds and be free....</description>

		<description>You think firefox is fast? I also thought that - until I tried chrome! That&#039;s really web in lightspeed (especially for javascript, which get&#039;s more important every day).

I still use firefox a lot, for web development for example and because it has such a great variaty of plugins. But when I want slim and fast surfing, I prefer chrome. Give it a try, it&#039;s so fast!</description>

		<description>Am a new convert to Mozilla and absolutely love it. The greatest joy is the lack of advertising – equalled only by the freedom from ‘news’. Not being forced to read (as on IE and AOL) about the doings of yet another ‘celeb’ is like a breath of fresh country air!!</description>

		<description>I love Firefox. I recommend it to everybody.  I&#039;m sorry for the people who service so many computers who have to walk their customers through, but I think that means the the computer awareness level needs to rise.  If people are going to use their computers they should understand them more.  At least the basics, so they can surf the web with confidence and navigate all the information to avoid the bad and learn to find the good. This way they won&#039;t be afraid of a window popping up and asking them which browser they would like to use.</description>
