		<description>After the most recent Firefox upgrade, I find that every time [every, every, every time] I click on the scrolling news line on my AOL toolbar [which is extant regardless of browser] Firefox crashes, crashes, and crashes again. I don&#039;t know how you &#039;improved&#039; it last time, but perhaps you could go back to the unimproved, previous version.</description>

		<description>Hi, I am a Mozilla user. It is very difficult to find Help and then to custom the home screen. One of the problems seems to be the integration of Google sites, I now open with Google scholar, I have to click on blogs to get to Gmail. Sometimes I have Google, iGoogle, or Chrome and of course scholar. Yes, I am a novice but very active reliance on the Net.
Some guidence would help</description>

		<description>The new Firefox 3.6 is AWFUL! Why can&#039;t you leave well enough alone? None of my bookmarks will deploy, and the browser freezes incessantly. That&#039;s what happens when you leave important &quot;update&quot; decisions to computer freaks as opposed to users. Microsoft says &quot;Hello!&quot;</description>

		<description>Do not mention privacy and Microsoft at the same time as Microsoft has given so called law enforcement ability to read our emails very easily.  The US government is quite forceful and I am sure Microsoft had little choice. 

So, question is, is their a company or entity that will give us privacy from the eyes of the US government?</description>

		<description>Just got the 3.6 Firefox upgrade. Upgrades to privacy for browsing history are nice, but still using old Netscape for privacy because it has a password protected privacy feature. Why not you?</description>
