		<description>Personally I do not want to see browser choice on any windows machine.  It was built with internet explorer in mind and should stay that way.  I have used the likes of mozilla and others and just don&#039;t like them.

Brussels should BACK OFF!!!</description>

		<description>People complaining about the force of providing choice need to take into consideration that progress of web design standards has been impeded to date because the majority of users get IE by default and don&#039;t have the option to choose a more progressive browser.  

The effect is limiting the standard rate of web standard progress to that of the IE team.   If most users weren&#039;t on IE driven systems, this wouldn&#039;t be an issue, but they are.  By presenting a choice, humans are statistically likely to even out that gap, which will result in a more balance and complete framework for web design in the future.

I&#039;m an administrator at a small business, and the users honestly don&#039;t care which browser they use.  They simply want it to work.  Their only gripe is when sites are designed specifically for IE, and thus don&#039;t work properly in Mozilla.  

All the web based infections/problems I have dealt with on the job have come from from IE users, and the employees themselves can attest to this correlation.  If not I would not have been able to get them to accept the necessity of dual usage.

Recently, I finally had an IE coworker log into a site for their job which would not work properly in IE8 without forcing compatibility mode, but which worked just fine in Mozilla.  It was fun to see them finally realize that IE is not the definition of a normal web browser.  

As the browser usage levels even out, I think we&#039;ll see a lot more of this.  IE will have to change to become a standards interoperable system, instead of one that requires a very specific type of design concurrent to progress.  Currently, I don&#039;t think Microsoft recognizes an incentive to do that, only a need to change IEs appearance and lock down its security so that they look like a next generation browser to the uninformed user.

Beyond the need for progress, I think the plug-in system of Mozilla defines what a web browser should be.  A flexible and adaptable system for using the web.  

Many users are amazed when I show them Ad-Block Plus, Colorzilla, and Personas.  They don&#039;t realize that they can easily understand and change their web experience because nobody tells them.  

Users rely on the information they get when they start using their computer to figure out what they can do, so I believe wholeheartedly that the simple mandate will improve the quality of the web and computer usage for all.</description>

		<description>I hated Internet Explorer before I even knew about other browsers being available.  Unfortunately I still have to use Internet Explorer because Microsoft forces us to use it for Microsoft Update.  I currently use mozilla Firefox on my PC with MS Windows 2000 Pro SP4,  MS Windows XP Pro SP4,  MS Windows 7,  and Linux Ubuntu and Freespire, all penta-booting on my system ( at least I think that&#039;s what it&#039;s called when you have five Operating Systems on the same PC ) and I run Opera on my iMac G3 with MAC OSX Panther installed.</description>

		<description>The problem with IE is that it cripples the web. It requires so much additional work for a web developer or webdesigner to make it Internet Explorer-compatible (honestly, 50% of my development time goes towards IE compatibility), that a lot of developers either don&#039;t have enough time to develop features, or simply switch to some proprietary IE &quot;standard&quot;, meaning it will be incompatible with just about every other non-IE browser. There are standards, and IE does not adhere to them, therefore you could say IE is &quot;at fault&quot;. If IE is going to adhere to the standards, fine, and you won&#039;t hear me complaining, but until Microsoft stops putting out crap, users should be made aware of the fact that there are other browsers (that, in the end, will help the development of the web because developers have more time to make up new concepts).

And then there&#039;s the huge number of security issues in Internet Explorer etc., but I&#039;m sure we all know that drill by now, so I won&#039;t start complaining about those. Currently IE is hindering web development, and that should be brought to a halt. I don&#039;t care whether that happens by phasing out IE and switching to other browsers, or by making IE standards-compliant, but it really should be fixed up somehow.</description>

		<description>Firefox is ace, I like IE, The EU should not get involved in regards to a consumer choice concept being driven, Firefox does well via word of mouth and not being a martyr to the Microsoft platform. They build their os, it&#039;s there right to install whatever they want on it by default and it&#039;s my right to customise the hell out of it. I don&#039;t use IE directly only via the IE-Tab add-on for Firefox when certain activex controls are desired. Most of the time when I fix a customers computer I install Firefox for them after removal of the various malware installed by IE, saying that chrome is just as bad.  Maybe another angle is better advertising, use the media advantage or just carry on as normal because each day more and more people switch to FF.</description>

		<description>Nice step. Next step is OS choice, when a computer first boots you should have the choice between a couple OS-ses, also non microsoft ones like: (free)BSD, Fedora, Centos, Redhat, Ubuntu, Minix, Debian, (open)Suse, etc...</description>
