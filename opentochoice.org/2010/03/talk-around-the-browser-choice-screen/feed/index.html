		<description>I have been supporting MS products on an enterprise level for few years . For all the shortcomings around IE, most of the enterprise apps have a requirement for it.Hell, they even work better on it . Developers have better options for IE compared to other browsers.Lets say a fairly non tech person who spends 8 hrs in front of an IE screen at work would rather prefer it than pick up Firefox etc. and then customise accordingly.Dont take me as a MSft fanboy. I use Firefox at home and work primarily as much as possible, however I do feel that forcing Msft to take such a step is wrong. After all they do not block other browser installations. eg A car manufacturer has the right to put his own audio system in a car. Its upto the customer to use it or install another brand. This may have a -ve impact on other browser vendors as they now seem to be abusing on the Msft litigations. deja vu anyone..</description>

		<description>I just changed back to Firefox from Chrome as it has only been in the market for 15 month and is missing some basic features. As of the ballot screen this is my opinion: It is useless in the way it is today. At no. 1 either the entire world should get it or no one. It is only in Europe now. This is not going to change anything. And so does it not even help the disappearance of IE6. Users who care a little bit about the browser they are using already changed from IE. Those who do not will not change anyway. And anyway IE7 and IE8 are quite good. They are not bad at all. So those who are using them may not even have a single reason to change. So I hope this helps to erase IE6 from computers at least but if there is only a ballot screen in Europe and if there is only as much told about the browsers in the ballot screen as there is today it is USELESS.</description>

		<description>I develop software for a living and I&#039;ve used any browser I could get my hands on to test web apps. And to tell the truth, I don&#039;t really care for the browser! To me, they are all just an address and search bar with a few navigation buttons. My machine and my laptop are powerful enough to run any browser without any lag and I keep them all up to date and never noticed any bug or security issue.

There is only one reason I&#039;m using Firefox : The plugins! AdBlock+ is the biggest weight in the balance. Lazarus saves me from losing a long email every now and then, DownloadStatusBar helps me keep track of multiple downloads without invading my screen and FasterFox&#039;s Endless Page feature proves useful when reading blogs, etc by loading the next page in the background right below the one I&#039;m currently reading.

Firefox is the best because of the community supporting it and the various addons. Firefox is the best because it provides me with choice. So that ballot screen, how useful is it? If it can just make people understand that double-clicking the IE icon doesn&#039;t open &quot;internet&quot;, it opens a &quot;browser&quot; which interprets the web and this browser isn&#039;t the only one to exist, then we&#039;ve given the user the power to choose and in turn, this will fuel innovation in the browser market.</description>

		<description>I&#039;m forced to use IE at work, because the corporate IT dept haven&#039;t implemented a choice, and we can&#039;t install 3rd party software. It&#039;s awful, slow and just seems so out of date. At home I used to use Firefox but found Safari to be faster, and &quot;cleaner&quot; and it interfaces slightly better with my Mac, although it has minor niggles. I&#039;ve recently tried Chrome, but not convinced enough to make the switch. My kids regularly switch between Firefox, Safari &amp; Chrome with ease.
As for &quot;when Apple will be forced to make the choice available?&quot;, I&#039;d suggest that Apple users are by definition aware of choice, and more likely to exercise it than those, who by definition have stuck with Microsoft products. Incidentally if you look at Microsoft&#039;s web pages, guess who&#039;s products you see? If you look at Apple&#039;s, sure you&#039;ll see theirs, but you also see thousands of others of competitors, such as Firefox, ready for easy download. But no objection in principle to more choice...</description>

		<description>When do we start having the EC pressure Apple to put the browser choice screen into installations of OS X?  They have essentially the same &quot;lack of choice&quot; of browsers on the Mac platform by bundling Safari (not to mention iTunes and iEverythingElse).

If browser choice is something that people are serious about, let&#039;s do it all the way -- I&#039;d expect to see browser choice screens in all commercial Linux distributions and Google&#039;s forthcoming ChromeOS as well.</description>

		<description>I was a fan of FF, till I started using chrome. I was stuck with FF for some time since the extensions were not available with Chrome, but now its all Google&#039;s Chrome. I don&#039;t even have a FF instance on my machine now. 

Though IE 8 (rarely used) is also good but Chrome beats IE and FF hands down in terms of speed. FF sucks in start up time and leaks memory like anything.. so no point installing FF atleast.</description>
