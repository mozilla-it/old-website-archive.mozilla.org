		<description>I have always disliked IE, particularly after I BOUGHT my first copy of Mosaic back in the old days.   From that point on, it was always Moaic, Netscape, or Firefox.  For the last ten years I have been using Macs, but still use Firefox.</description>

		<description>lol. As I was saying...

... and others) will not work properly with other operating systems. So apart from that, Firefox has had no trouble at all displaying any site I&#039;ve visited.

Performance-wise, extensive testing has been done by the community and the results were as you&#039;d probably expect: some content is rendered faster than it is by other browsers, some content not so quickly. So it doesn&#039;t win by any means in this respect but it certainly doesn&#039;t lose. 

Security? Inherently more secure than IE and most other browsers. You can disagree with that one all you like but it is a fact.

Stability? More stable than most browsers I can assure you, but it does have issues and can sometimes just crash for the sake of it seemingly. This may be due sometimes to a shoddily built add-on, other times it may be ... well ... just for the sake of it. lol. So it doesn&#039;t win in this area but again it doesn&#039;t lose.

User interface... In this area it wins hands down, no question. Standard menu bar with everything where it should be, back, forward, refresh, cancel, home, address bar, search box, status bar at the bottom. End of story. Lovely. If you&#039;re reading this, Mozilla peeps, and you haven&#039;t already picked your eyes out so you&#039;ll never have to read this again, LEAVE THE USER INTERFACE ALONE. For the love of all that&#039;s holy don&#039;t start making it look like Chrome or any of that nonsense.

In conclusion, Firefox meets all the criteria to a standard that is at a minimum perfectly acceptable and at a maximum superb. I don&#039;t think this can be said about any other browser. IE is about as secure as a convertible with it&#039;s top down, Chrome is basically a toy that could be out-surfed by someone with no legs... I could go on but I won&#039;t bother.

Also, Try Thunderbird if you haven&#039;t already.

Keep up the good work, Mozilla.</description>

		<description>I have been using computers for many years and am a computing professional and an amateur programmer. I take things seriously when it comes to the applications I choose. As one above poster has stated, it&#039;s all about the criteria. Apart from that ineffable fact I do not agree with him on any other point. I will again list the criteria according to that poster and add a couple more myself:

* Compatibility
* Performance
* Security
* Stability
* User interface design

To my mind, I can think of only one circumstance when Firefox has not met the first criterion: Silverlight + Linux. And that is hardly down to Mozilla. There&#039;s not much Mozilla can do about the fact that Microsoft will (of course) go out of their way to make sure their technologies (.NET, Silverlight and others)</description>

		<description>Yeah kudos @gb. Opera rocks. It comes fully packed with features and is very fast. I also use FF, IE, Chrome and Safari. They all have something good about them but it would be nice if they all would follow W3C standards. I believe Opera and Webkit are currently the closest.</description>

		<description>i think all the mainstream browsers have their upsides, IE have stepped up their game re: standards, firefox has opened some eyes to choice, opera is an innovator, chrome is fast and light. they&#039;ve all got down-sides too. 

as web monkey i use all of the above a fair bit, with core browsing on Opera. 

Open source, fully configurable via opera:config or simple .ini files, gesture based browsing, good with web standards and security. 

pop-up blockers, speed dial, irc, torrents, email, rss feeds, developer console, saved browsing sessions, closed tab history, user defined interface behaviour, click &amp; drag layout control, widgets, interactive themes, custom scripts, active spellchecker, streamlined &amp; secure password manager, notes, it&#039;s all there already. and to top it off you can download or develop mods and add-ons.

i&#039;m hardly touching the surface with it myself, but my experience is that opera blows the other browsers away, and everyone i&#039;ve introduced to it have loved it.</description>
