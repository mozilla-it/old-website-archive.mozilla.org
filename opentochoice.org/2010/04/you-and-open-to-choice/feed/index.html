		<description>I have been using Firefox for so long I do not remember all the reasons I sought to exit IE.  Since then IE has undergone several evolutions, Chrome has arrived, and Apple has heavily eroded MS&#039; monopoly.  The ideological reasons for switching are no longer relevant, the dangers from the mad capitalists who seek to milk us and zombie us are a threat to all, including Apple users.  But Firefox is a wonderful, flexible constantly evolving tool which has never let me down.  I do not know whether it is a Maserati, a Volkswagen, or a Volvo but I do know when I turn the key it starts every time.  If I have a problem there are communities of people out there who talk to me and answer my questions.  I wish any part of my government performed at 1/10th the satisfaction I received all the time, every day from Firefox.  Thank you.</description>

		<description>Firefox is a good protected browser for any internet users.But some time its taken so much time to load.But its my favorite.
I like google crome only for its light feature.But most irritating thing is close tab.If you close the browser all tab will close.
I just Hate IE.It has no class at all.</description>
