		<description>i am in Pacific region and i use Firefox, but I must still have IE on my PC, as it is needed to access so many other sites/apps on the internet. At least in this region...
I prefer Mozilla Firefox as there seems to be better security, something that i have always had trouble with at IE, also there is a lot more apps in Firefox one doesn&#039;t get with IE.</description>

		<description>I would just like to have a browser that doesn&#039;t give someone the chance to give my info out and I have to delete it all from my spam folder without ever knowing how they know that I search certain sites!</description>

		<description>Why Does It Seem Everyone Is Taking Up Microsofts Side When Its Their Browser That Counts For Most Infection Points In The Malware Side Besides Adobe Software.. Microsoft Failed At Creating A Great Browser Like Firefox Or Opera Simply Because Its A Forced Program And Is Intergrated With Windows And Isn&#039;t Open Source.</description>

		<description>as a web developer ... yes choice is great but how about the EU sticking its big nose in and forcing ALL user agents to fully comply with one standard instead of charging customers, testing and conformity with just about anyone who wants to write a bit of browser software - I&#039;m fed up of going on websites to don&#039;t work in one browser but do in others - who picks up the labour cost for all this compatibility testing &quot;CLIENT&quot; so in effect anyone paying for a website pays for your right of choice rather than forcing all browsers to COMPLY - I&#039;d assimilate you all and we&#039;d have one browser BORG 1.1</description>

		<description>How many people have wanted to give another browser a try, so asked around to get some opinions or advise only to hear: &quot;well right now I use netzero&quot; (or similar), &quot;but I&#039;m so tired of dial-up,  god its just so slow&quot;. or &quot;I have dsl through AT&amp;T, but i&#039;m thinking of switching to comcast&quot;. The point i&#039;m trying to make is that a lot of people don&#039;t even know what a browser is, forget about how to change/configure one. Another point I would like to make, competition under most circumstances is normally healthy, I think this is going to be a good thing.</description>

		<description>why should microsoft have the right to make a profit from all the development work they&#039;ve done its their duty to the world to give up the products we want for free. after all aren&#039;t they a charity? everyone who wants to should have the right to demand a free ride from any one who works and get a portion handed to them just for the want of it. after all isn&#039;t that what a business is ? no wonder my neighbors think i owe them for having bought a home near them. I just didn&#039;t get it !</description>
