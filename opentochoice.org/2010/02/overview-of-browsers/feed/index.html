		<description>To M.E. - you&#039;re comment about most browsers being simply a filter running MSIE under them suggests strongly that you&#039;re not really &quot;up&quot; on this subject.</description>

		<description>I used Internet Explorer for many years and continuously had problems from day one. I was so pleased to finally get away from them and found my experience with Mozilla Firefox problem free and my computer that I thought was going out, wasn&#039;t. My problems where with internet explorer, once I got away from them, my computer runs much faster and I have been problem free. I Love it, wouldn&#039;t dream of changing. I give you an A+ keep up the good work....</description>

		<description>Oh, one last thing --- It would be really nice too if Mozilla could add the option to Open a page using IE like (I think it is) Chrome does... Extremely helpful when playing certain games on-line!!</description>

		<description>As to Sethu&#039;s comment - March 7, 2010...

I have to agree with you! Google&#039;s Chrome (browser) does seem to be the best out there right now...  For the reasons you mentioned and also much more secure and lot less bugs in the program - Rarely have I had Chrome close down on me.  And it has many options that the others just don&#039;t have or what they have is not as user friendly!!  However, I believe that many people do not really even attempt to become familiar with the Chrome browser because it appears so different than what they are used to with Internet Explorer or Mozilla Firefox... You do have to become accustomed to the differences in navigating the program itself - things are placed very differently and very different in appearance.

I actually would rate the major browsers in this order (from best to worst)

1. Google Chrome
2. Mozilla Firefox
3. Flock
4. Opera
5. Internet Explorer
6. Safari
7. Netscape

Just my personal observation anyway, but I feel that I would probably like Mozilla better and put it as number 1 IF the Add-On&#039;s did not cause the program itself to run SO SLOW, IF it has a  built-in Download Manager that wasn&#039;t so annoying and it was more customizable and IF I hadn&#039;t noticed so many more issues with it than it ever had previously...  

Just to clarify, however, at this time I have Mozilla, Chrome and IE installed on my computers and I DO primarily use Mozilla Firefox, but only because there still so many sites that can only be viewed on IE or Mozilla and not Chrome as of yet!  Fix the glitches and make a few changes though and you would win me over to Firefox completely!!  :)  I suggest that if someone is uncertain, download them all and check them out and see what works best for their individual needs!</description>

		<description>Just having a list of browsers for people to choose from isn&#039;t a helpful choice.  There needs to be more information about what distinguishes them than just which OSs they run on.</description>

		<description>I Love Firefox, of course now Chrome is the fastest browser as I know, but I still love Firefox, really &quot;open&quot; to user :D. I think Chrome just a faster version of Safari with Extensions from Firefox :)).</description>
