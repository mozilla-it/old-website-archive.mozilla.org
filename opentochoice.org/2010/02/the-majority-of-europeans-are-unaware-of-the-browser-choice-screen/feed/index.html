		<description>I&#039;ve been using firefox for several years now, and I always tell people to use it...especially when people have periodically been freaked out by an internet explorer virus.  So to me, the internet looks like a globe with an orange fox wrapped around it.</description>

		<description>I&#039;m not surprised. Most computer users take the view that they don&#039;t need to actually know about a computer in order to use it. They use Microsoft Internet Explorer simply because it does the job and its there ready to use. Its only when you become more interested in the ins-and-outs of computers that you become aware that you have a choice in the tools you use every day. Also, in my view, Microsoft have been very clever with the forced inclusion of the browser choice screen - despite the update being installed on all my systems, I have yet to see it actually pop up anywhere. I also think that there can be too many choices, and this will cause users to simply pick one they recognise, for example Google, or Firefox, without actually using or testing them to see if they are suitable for their needs. I use Firefox, and I made this decision through testing a bunch of alternative browsers, and selecting the one I preferred... its niave to assume that everyone goes through this process.</description>

		<description>The screen is being shown in Europe only because according to research (research that I, being a statistician, lead), of the six continents (excluding Antarctica), Europe was the one with the highest percentage of computer-owners using IE. According to some long-forgotten bylaw, when majorities are this big, alternate choices must be offered. Although, I do think that Europe is overestimating it&#039;s computer-owners. I bet two-thirds of those people don&#039;t know what a browser is and will choose Chrome because they know what Google is and have no idea what Mozilla or any other of the companies/organizations are.</description>

		<description>It&#039;s been more than 3 years, I think, since I&#039;ve changed to Firefox. The choice I made at that time was perfect and very secure for my Internet browsing!
The reason people don&#039;t know about the choice is they never heard about them ! So browser choice is good for the consumers to decide which one they want than have to put up with IE. 
IE is fine but for more secure browsing I would prefer Firefox. 

It&#039;s true most people use Windows. It&#039;s called ethical marketing/business when you leave the choice with consumer!</description>

		<description>Seriously, this is stupid. Microsoft made Windows, sells it, and maintains it. Therefore, they should be able to decide what THEY want to be in their software when they sell it. Forget Opera for starting this drama, but ridiculous of all other browsers to jump on the bandwagon because you think it will increase your market share. 

Get over it, it&#039;s called selling a product the way you make the product.</description>

		<description>I like the way they renamed IE to &quot;Windows Internet Explorer&quot;, so they could put it at the bottom of there alphabetical list.</description>

		<description>Its a BROWSER.  Why is there such a gigantic deal about it?  Its free and they all take you to the same internet.  If Microsoft didn&#039;t include a browswer, how would you download a different one?

And this site is by Mozilla?  I total see the &quot;open to choice&quot; here...um...maybe a bias towards Firefox?</description>
