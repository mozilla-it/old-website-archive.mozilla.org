		<description>Dear John and Mitchell;
     You are absolutely correct, the browser you use has a tremendous impact on how you interact with the Web and how you feel about what you have or have not accomplished. I have been involved in the whole Wintel consortium starting in 1984 and ending in 1996. Bill Gates&#039; business model is geared towards an old adage I heard years ago; &quot;If you can&#039;t convince them with the facts, dazzle them with bullshit.&quot; He also approached the marketplace by letting them all join in the development and growth of the IBM/Intel/Microsoft by opening their architecture to every Tom, Dick and Harry that  may be able to develop a peripheral or some application specific software. How many Beta sites does Microsoft use today? Must be over 250,000! After using IE whatever, I was reminded of a dog chasing it&#039;s tail, and of course, never catching up. A nickel for every patch and HotFix and KB whatever number, I&#039;d be rich.  My point is that I have never felt secure with Microsoft products as a whole, but they are the 800 pound gorilla in the room. But, I get to draw the line at my browser.  I have used both IE7 and Mozilla-Firefox. I am very impressed with their collaboration that provides me a browser I can trust. Mozilla-Firefox makes me feel secure when I&#039;m online and I believe they have my back. In the world of the net, that refers to and portals and WinSockets, the back door into my World Wide Web experience. As a disabled Veteran, I now think about starting a Web based business here at the house. My research and development is crucial and I need a browser from competent and committed people. I have found that in this product and I would suggest using Mozilla-Firefox as your default browser. They are proof that an open source forum and the sharing of  their fruits can be the best deal, and America has discovered that some real good things can come at no monetary cost to them. But as Americans, we pride ourselves on our ingenuity and our competence when the chips are down. The Net needed a browser with control of it&#039;s purpose and not searching for the next patch to fix the gaping hole in its backdoor. Chose Mozilla-Firefox and you can give the Valium back to the Doctor, relax and enjoy your Web experience. I have found that Mozilla has given me the best tool I could get; a secure yet robust browser that I don&#039;t have to worry about. I have so many other things to worry about, not my browser. Thank you Mozilla, John and Mitchell for providing a great product, Sincerely, Vanwyck</description>

		<description>I thought that I was bloomin&#039; crazy after some purportedly &quot;computer expert&quot; crashed my computer and caused a myriad disasters/ Then a gentleman who teaches at a local adult school rescued me with Firefox, about which I know  nothing whatsoever. All computer language is a formidable opponent to me and read as I may even the word browser is intimidating! As an English ex-pat in California I would like us all to return to the typewriter and telephone.!!!!!!!!!!!!!</description>

		<description>I found this information to be informative about peoples views and opinions. I still do not know how to choose a browser and the choices that I have to choose from. Also, if I decide that I don&#039;t want the browser that I chose, how can I can back?</description>

		<description>I wish that Mozilla had the &quot;Save to Desktop&quot; option like the iE (microsoft) browser and a button/option to save whole browser page (like Chrome) according to the individual tabs, so if you need to shut down browser window (which happens quite often now, with all the glitches the newer versions of Mozilla seems to have), you can restart just the window you want to at some point in the future without all of them (individual browser windows) being restored at once or losing what is not restored later on!  It is nice that you can finally be a little more creative with your window now, but still needs a lot more to offer I think when one has the lag time and other issues to deal with that seem to be inevitable lately, especially if using any Add-Ons.</description>

		<description>I used to love Firefox.  I am switching. I hate Microsoft for idealistic
reasons and I&#039;d prefer not to go back to IE but I have. I&#039;m even using
IE to send you this message. So can you tell me why your browser sucks
now? Are you intentionally trying to drive people away from it? I t seem
so. All my friends who used to swear by Firefox are going back to other
browsers despite the reasons that originally made Firefox seem like a
superior browser. 

The problem is it doesn&#039;t do what it is supposed to do more and more in
various different ways too numerous to even remember. It worked before
but you broke it by &quot;fixing &quot; it. I regret ever updating it. Java is
slow. Adobe Flash plug-in will not install, or when it says it did it
will not work. Anything .flv either doesn&#039;t work or sucks. This makes
navigating Myspace or many other popular sites impossible. I keep
getting messages saying firefox has prevented me from being re-directed
to pages I want to go to, sometimes getting caught up in a loop that
doesn&#039;t end until the tab or window is closed manually. Youtube videos
sometimes won&#039;t work. Even if I go back to 3.5.x it still sucks.
Letters won&#039;t show up for 5 seconds or more after being typed. Bookmarks
wont display. Sometimes gmail just won&#039;t load...ridiculous. Everything
takes forever...what a disaster!

I NOTICED THAT MANY OF THE OTHER PEOPLE HERE IN THE FORUMS ASKING FOR
ANSWERS AND HELP ABOUT WHY FIREFOX IS REACTING SO BADLY DIDN&#039;T GET TOO
MUCH SUPPORT FROM THE SO CALLED &quot;SUPPORT&quot; STAFF! 
WHY IS THE STAFF A BUNCH OF ONLINE JANITORS THAT ONLY CLEAN UP THE
USER&#039;S MESS AND NOT THEIR OWN!!!??? 

Where can I download an old  version of Firefox that actually works and
doesn&#039;t suck?</description>

		<description>Choice within a determination...I think it´s bizarre. Microsoft should not pre install the Internet Explorer and let the people find another browse. Microsoft disapointed me as the huge and dominant company it is. They should fight. If I buy a PC with Windows I know that the default program for browsing the internet is the Explorer. If I WANT another one I should install by myself and as a free will. This &quot;choice&quot; screen is for stupid people. I would love to see a Windows based PC without Explorer pre installed. And before you attack me: I don´t use Explorer. I choose my preferred browser. By myself. With no stupid screen.</description>

		<description>MOZILLA FIREFOX will rule for those who understand the very meaning of a great web browser. Those who know or choose to continuously learn how to utilize 99% ( let&#039;s face it 100% is not possible due to constant breakthroughs and updates which is fine with me! ) of Firefox&#039;s capabilities will always appreciate it. Mozilla is placed up on the highest of pedistals due to their educating those who need products dumbed down for them. This article blog is an outstanding example of their dedication to public service! Mozilla Firefox is # 1 !!!!!!</description>
