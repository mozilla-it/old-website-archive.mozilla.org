			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you want to promote browser choice in your community, there are a number of ways to go about it.  So far, Open to Choice has essentially been online, (on this website, on Twitter, on blogs, on social networks), and in the media, as the campaign has been featured in a number of publications.  We invite anyone who is passionate about browser choice to engage in other activities to spread the word to as many people as possible.</p>
<p><strong>Give a talk<br />
</strong><br />
If you enjoy public speaking: is there a local event where the topic of browser choice is a good fit?  A group or body which uses technology, but it is not necessarily technology-centric, might find such a talk especially useful: help people to understand that they can improve their online experience, or at least choose it for themselves.  With the browser choice screen still a news topic, it is a very good time to go out and give a talk on how much the browser defines people’s experience online.</p>
<p><strong>Organize a booth</strong></p>
<p>If you enjoy meeting people: is there is a technology event which is looking for participants, where you could set up a booth?  We can help with Open To Choice materials, and you could display all browsers, and use materials from other campaigns, such as <a href="http://www.whatbrowser.org" target="_blank">whatbrowser.org</a> and <a href="http://www.browsehappy.com">browsehappy.com</a>.  If you&#8217;d like help with producing materials, get in touch!</p>
<p><strong>Distribute flyers</strong></p>
<p>If you&#8217;d like to distribute flyers to people, you can download and print the Open to Choice <a href="http://opentochoice.org/2010/02/flyer/" target="_blank">flyer</a> and distribute them locally. You can either give them away to passers-by, put them in post boxes or leave some at your shop, school or workplace for visitors to take.</p>
<p><strong>Put up posters</strong></p>
<p>We have created both color and black and white posters, which are easy to <a href="http://opentochoice.org/2010/02/poster-a4-colour/" target="_blank">download</a> and print. You can put them up in your apartment building, school, local community center or place of work (please ask permission first!).</p>
<p>No matter what you choose to do (and maybe you have your own ideas), we believe that educating people around you on the subject of browser choice can be both fun and a service to your community.  If you do take part in any of these activities, do take your friends with you and take some photos.  You can put them up on your favourite photo sharing site and please send us a link.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We’ve been writing a series of posts to help you choose your browser.</p>
<p>If you want to know what features you should look for when choosing a browser, we’ve explained <a href="http://opentochoice.org/2010/03/choosing-a-web-browser-where-do-i-start/">what a browser is</a><span style="text-decoration: underline;"> </span>, and how to choose one which <a href="http://opentochoice.org/2010/03/choosing-a-web-browser-security/">protects your privacy</a> <em> </em>while surfing. Today we’ll be looking at browser customisation and performance.</p>
<p><strong>What should I look for?</strong></p>
<p>Many browsers offer at least some degree of customisation, from changing how the buttons look to tailoring it to meet your exact needs. You might be able to block adverts or make your computer more secure. To customise your browser, you should find out what options (often called “add-ons” or “extensions”) are available and the extent to which your browser can be personalised.</p>
<p>How fast your browser loads a Web page is a common measure of performance. Your Internet connection, your computer and the page itself can affect page load time, but your browser can too to a great extent.</p>
<p>But performance is more than the speed of page loads. Certain browsers may need more memory than others (slowing down other functions in the process), and some may crash more frequently than others. The best way to test performance is to visit the same website on several browsers and see which one feels best.</p>
<p>The language you browse in is another consideration. If you’re reading this in English, it’s almost certain your browser will be available in the right language. Otherwise you may need to research your options as the number of browsers in different languages can vary widely.</p>
<p>With any piece of software, problems may occur from time to time. So, it is worth making sure your browser has free customer support available in case you need help. Many programmes have user communities and developers who volunteer their time and knowledge to help others. Being part of a user community can greatly improve your experience!</p>
<p>Finally, just have a think about whether you <em>enjoyed</em> using your browser. The Web can be a wonderful place! With nearly limitless potential for learning, connecting and creativity, the Internet and the way you experience it can be enhanced by a good browser. What add-ons or customisations have you made to your browser? Leave your tips and comments below!</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This is the second post in our series of posts to help inform you about what to look for when choosing a Web browser. Read our <a href="http://opentochoice.org/2010/03/choosing-a-web-browser-where-do-i-start/">previous post</a><span style="text-decoration: underline;"> </span>for some starting points, or read on for more information about browsers and your online security, privacy and data.</p>
<p><strong>What should I look for?</strong></p>
<p>Your privacy online is an important aspect of choosing your browser. Your browsing history generates an enormous amount of personal information about you and your interests. The nature of the Web means the sites you go to will have a record of your visit (by your “IP address”, a unique number which identifies your computer on the Internet), and this data is also stored in your browser. Some browsers allow you to choose whether this data is collected, or to delete this data after you have visited a website. On the other hand, the browser supplier may have access to all this information collected about you. If this is a concern, we strongly recommend reading the privacy policy of the software you’re using or considering.</p>
<p>Your online security is also very important, particularly if you share personal information such as credit card details while shopping or banking online. Some browsers contain features to help you identify online scams (“phishing”), malicious software (“malware”) or sites which have been compromised. Familiarise yourself with the security options your chosen browser offers (usually described on the browser’s website), and always use the most up-to-date version of your browser to protect yourself against the latest threats.</p>
<p>Finally, your browser can make managing your online data easy! As we spend more and more time online, we create and share more data about ourselves: bookmarks (also called favourites), browsing history, and passwords. It can be difficult to remember all your passwords or find a site you visited weeks earlier, so being able to access this data and even move it from one computer to another can be extremely useful. Several browsers allow you to do this, thus giving you “anytime, anywhere” access to your information.</p>
<p>We’d love to hear your comments on what you think are the most important things to consider when thinking about the security of your browser. Stay tuned for our next post on customising your browser to your needs.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>What was the settlement the European Commission reached with Microsoft?</strong></p>
<p>In December 2009, <a href="http://europa.eu/rapid/pressReleasesAction.do?reference=IP/09/1941&amp;format=HTML&amp;aged=0&amp;language=EN&amp;guiLanguage=en">Microsoft reached an agreement with the European Commission</a> to resolve the European Commissions concerns that Microsoft violated EU competition law. As part of this agreement, Microsoft agreed to adopt a number of operating principles, referred to as Commitments, that implementing a ‘Browser Choice screen’ for all Windows users in Europe when Internet Explorer is sold with a computer and pre-set as the default Web browser. This screen gives users the choice of staying with their default Web browser, or choosing from a number of alternatives. In a phased roll-out starting on February 23, 2010, an estimated 190 million users in 32 European countries will be shown this screen.</p>
<p><strong>What was Mozilla’s role in the European Commission settlement process?</strong></p>
<p>Mozilla joined the process as an &#8220;interested party.&#8221; This means we were allowed to review and comment on proceedings between Microsoft and the EC.  We were not a complainant.   We outlined a series of principles regarding respecting user choice as critical parts of any remedy – this reflects Mozilla&#8217;s non-profit mission to bring individual empowerment into Internet life.  We also commented on the implementation of the Browser Choice screen though we did not propose this remedy.</p>
<p>Throughout our participation, Mozilla Chair, Mitchell Baker blogged about the process and you can read that <a href="http://blog.lizardwrangler.com/">here</a>.</p>
<p><strong>During the process, Mozilla indicated that they were more excited about other parts of the ruling than the Browser Choice screen itself. What are they?</strong></p>
<p>While the ballot mechanism represented by the Browser Choice screen has received the most attention, Mozilla is most pleased with the core principles Microsoft will be adopting that protect the choices a person has already made. These principles are expressed in several components of the Commitments and together should result in a greater respect for individual human decisions.</p>
<p>When Mozilla joined the case as an interested third party, Mitchell Baker <a href="http://blog.lizardwrangler.com/2009/02/24/ec-list-of-potential-principles/">started a series of blog posts</a> to develop a set of principles that Mozilla believed should be addressed by any remedies in the case. The principle discussions were not about specific remedies themselves, rather they were about the goals that we thought any remedies should meet.</p>
<p>Of the various principles Mozilla proposed in public discussion around the case, the ones that got the strongest positive response are those that protect the choices people have already made or are trying to make in regard to their Web browser. The issues we identified were formally incorporated into the settlement. These are <a href="http://blog.lizardwrangler.com/2009/02/27/ec-principle-1-respecting-previous-choice/">1: Respecting Previous Choice</a> and <a href="http://blog.lizardwrangler.com/2009/03/18/ec-principle-2-windows-must-not-provide-a-technical-advantage-to-ie/">2: Windows Must Not Provide a Technical Advantage to IE</a>.</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>How does the Browser Choice screen work?</strong></p>
<p>Microsoft explains how and when the Browser Choice screen will roll out in <a href="http://microsoftontheissues.com/cs/blogs/mscorp/archive/2010/02/19/the-browser-choice-screen-for-europe-what-to-expect-when-to-expect-it.aspx">this blog post.</a></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>What does the Browser Choice screen look like?</strong></p>
<p>You can see the Browser Choice screen at this<a href="http://www.browserchoice.eu/"> link</a>.</p>
<p><strong>What Web browsers are included on the Browser Choice screen?</strong></p>
<p>These are the 12 browsers included on the Browser Choice screen.  We encourage people to read about them and talk to friends and colleagues so they can learn more about their options.</p>
<ul>
<li>Apple Safari</li>
<li>Avant Browser</li>
<li>Flock</li>
<li>Google Chrome</li>
<li>GreenBrowser</li>
<li>K-Meleon</li>
<li>Maxthon</li>
<li>Mozilla Firefox</li>
<li>Opera</li>
<li>Sleipnir</li>
<li>Slim Browser</li>
<li>Windows Internet Explorer</li>
</ul>
<p>Not all Web browsers are included on the Browser Choice screen.  People might want to consider these options as well. Note, not all of them run on the Windows operating system.</p>
<ul>
<li>Amaya</li>
<li>Camino</li>
<li>Epiphany</li>
<li>iCab</li>
<li>Konqueror</li>
<li>SeaMonkey</li>
<li>TheWorld</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What is the goal of Mozilla’s Open to Choice campaign?</strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p>The goal of our Open to Choice campaign is to raise awareness among Web users in Europe about the importance of making informed choices about the software and services they use to access the Internet. It launches at a time when an estimated 190 million of Europeans in 32 countries will be asked to make a choice about which Web browser will act on their behalf to broker their online experiences.</p>
<p>As a first step, we want as many people as possible to consider the choice of Web browsers presented to them as part of the Browser Choice screen. We believe that the Browser Choice screen is an important milestone towards helping more people take control of their online lives &#8212; and we hope for the conversation to become broader and deeper. We&#8217;ve set up <a href="about:blank" target="_blank">opentochoice.org</a> as one place for people to discuss what this choice means to them.</p>
<p><strong>Why is choosing a Web browser an important decision?</strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p>Every day we make conscious choices about a myriad of things &#8211; some significant, some trivial. Although many people don’t consider a Web browser to be one of these choices, it’s one of the most important pieces of technology we use and definitely merits careful thought.</p>
<p>In fact, the Web browser has become one of the most critical and trusted relationships of our modern lives. It is the lens through which we look at the digital world, and the medium by which we connect, learn, share, and collaborate. The browser you choose is responsible for providing you with the necessary tools to manage your online life, and plays a key role in protecting your privacy and security. Making an informed choice on which browser you use is the first step towards the best possible experience on the Web.</p>
<p><strong>Why is Mozilla taking on this role of informing and educating consumers?</strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p>Mozilla is a non-for-profit with a clear mission: Mozilla exists to ensure that the Internet as a global public resource remains open and accessible. Through Firefox, Mozilla demonstrated that the browser is critically important to each individual’s online experience and to the overall health of the Internet. Building a setting in which citizens understand they have a choice is a fundamental step in building an Internet that retains vibrancy, innovation and choice.</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Why is Mozilla launching this campaign now?</strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p>Mozilla believes that during this unique time when millions of people across Europe are perhaps for the first time considering their choice of Web browser, it is essential to provide information about the importance of the Web browser itself, rather than looking at specific product features.</p>
<p>It is Mozilla’s mission to promote choice, innovation and participation on the Internet. The Internet is an integral part of modern life – a key component in education, communication, collaboration, business, entertainment and society as a whole. As such, it is a public resource that must remain open and accessible and we want to make sure this message is heard by consumers.  In doing so, we hope they recognize the Browser Choice screen when it appears and will make an informed choice. <strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Will the Open to Choice campaign encourage people to download Firefox when they are presented with the Browser Choice screen?</strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p>Our campaign is not about pushing downloads for our browser product – Firefox –  but about getting Internet users interested in thinking about the importance of the Web browser to their online experience.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In the next few days we’ll be publishing a series of posts to help you make an informed choice about your browser. Today&#8217;s post looks at where to start when considering what browser(s) to choose.</p>
<p><strong>What is a browser?</strong></p>
<p>A browser is a piece of software that displays Web pages. Your browser influences the way you use the Web in a variety of ways, including how fast a page opens, how safe you are while surfing and how much of your data is shared with others.</p>
<p>Web browsers shouldn’t be confused with other key parts of your online experience, such as  operating  systems  (like  Windows,  Mac  or  Linux)  or  search  engines  (like  Google, Yahoo! or Bing).</p>
<p><a href="http://opentochoice.org/opentochoice_content/uploads/2010/03/What-is-a-Web-browser.png"><img class="what" src="http://opentochoice.org/opentochoice_content/uploads/2010/03/What-is-a-Web-browser.png" alt="" width="636" height="259" /></a></p>
<p><strong>What should I look for first?</strong></p>
<p>You can read our <a href="http://opentochoice.org/2010/02/overview-of-browsers/">overview of browsers here</a><span style="text-decoration: underline;"> </span>but if you haven’t thought much about choosing one, there are a few things to consider before making a decision.</p>
<p><em> </em></p>
<p>Is the browser you are considering free? Today, the most popular and well-respected browsers are free to users. If you come across a site demanding a fee before you can download a browser, it might be a scam.</p>
<p>Before downloading a browser, one of your first steps should be checking if the browser is supported by your computer. Our overview of browsers shows you which will work on which operating systems. If you have an older computer, your operating system may not support modern browsers.</p>
<p>Check that the browser you choose will display the sites you visit correctly. Not every browser works with every site.  When this happens, Web pages aren’t displayed correctly or are missing text or functionality. If pages aren’t displaying properly on one browser, you might want to try another option and compare.</p>
<p>Finally, you might want to consider how the browser is made. Software is created in a variety of ways. Some browsers are known as “open source” or “free software”. This means you can modify and use the programme however you like. Other browsers are “closed source” or “non-free.” Installing such software usually means that you’re bound by certain conditions, such as not modifying it in particular ways (even though it’s running on your computer).</p>
<p>In our next post on what to look for when choosing your browser we’ll be considering browser security and customising your browser to your needs. In the meantime, we’d like to hear what features you think are important when choosing a browser.</p>

<p>The agreement between the European Commission (EC) and Microsoft resonated with a lot of Mozilla community members, who support this campaign and went out to make a difference in their local community and change the way people around them perceive the Internet. This led to a lot of community-powered activities, from blogging to social networking and translation work to ensure that Web users are aware of this important decision.</p>
<p>Here is a quick overview:</p>
<ul>
<li>Francesco Lodolo from Italy wrote a blog post detailing his sighting of the browser choice screen and how the process works: <a href="http://www.yetanothertechblog.com/2010/03/06/european-browser-choice-with-screenshots/" target="_blank">Browser choice with screenshots.</a></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>FuzzyFox aka William D from the UK wrote a FAQ explaining what a browser is and why it’s important to choose: <a href="http://blog.brinkhurstdesign.co.uk/2010/03/choice-matters-so-does-your-browser/">Choice Matters. So Does Your Browser</a>.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Mozilla Hispano created an <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/30176726@N04/4417682816/">event page</a> on Tuenti, a very popular social network in Spain.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Tobbi, aka Tobias Markus from Germany wrote an article for the German community portal about choice and when to make one: <a href="http://www.camp-firefox.de/node/232">Die Qual der Wahl!</a></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Mozilla Czech Republic had a very nice <a href="http://www.mozilla.cz/zpravicky/vetsina-evropanu-o-okne-volby-weboveho-prohlizece-nevi/">blog post</a> on the community website as well.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Mozilla Bosnia and Herzegovina <a href="http://www.mozilla.ba/index.php?mact=News,cntnt01,detail,0&amp;cntnt01articleid=28&amp;cntnt01returnid=15">wrote</a> about Open to Choice on their community portal.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Wim Benes from the Netherlands wrote <a href="http://fjoerfoks.blogspot.com/2010/03/browserkarskerm.html">in Frisian</a> about the browser choice screen.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The blog you are reading has been translated into 14 languages by the famous Mozilla localizer teams</li>
</ul>
<p>This is just a snapshot of the hard work done to support the Open to Choice campaign.  We&#8217;re really proud to see people supporting the Open to Choice initiative as well as spreading the word about how important the browser is and how people all over the world can improve their online experience.</p>
<p>A big thank you to all of the people who contributed and still are contributing to Open to Choice and a hearty invite to everybody to join us in making the Web a better place.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As the <a href="http://europa.eu/rapid/pressReleasesAction.do?reference=IP/10/216&amp;format=HTML&amp;aged=0&amp;language=EN&amp;guiLanguage=en">European Commission made clear</a> the browser choice screen is intended to promote choice with consumers, and that this will stimulate both the browser market itself and adjacent markets dependent on web technologies.  And so, the browser choice screen is being delivered to Windows XP, Vista and 7 users who have Internet Explorer as their default browser.  But of course, a large number of people who use Internet Explorer do so at work, on a machine that belongs to their employer and the administration of which is someone else&#8217;s responsibility.</p>
<p>That means that the browser choice screen is being offered to people who are not necessarily empowered to make the choice of what software is, and is not installed on their machine.  And while it might seem nice to imagine a world where users could always choose the software they want to work with, an employer has requirements too: about which software they intend to support internally, which is compatible with their infrastructure, and so forth.  On top of that, it seems for many users, it is not immediately obvious what the browser choice screen is &#8211; it is unexpected (as we know, the majority of people are unaware what it is) and it might appear to some as though it is spam of some description.</p>
<p>In combination, this has meant some rather busy mornings for many of Europe&#8217;s system administrators.  If their users have systems which are accepting Windows updates, it seems they have been receiving lots of confused emails and telephone calls.</p>
<p>One such administrator by the nickname of &#8220;Pony&#8221; complained on Opentochoice of having 30 such complaints from users in one morning.  It seems that it is possible for sys admins to prevent the browser choice screen on all their users&#8217; machines.  If they are using System Centre Configuration Manager (SCCM), they need to disable update <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/976002">KB976002</a>.  And of course, we&#8217;d love it if while doing so, they could explain to all of their users who use Internet Explorer at home what the browser choice screen is!</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In the first week of Microsoft deploying the Browser Choice screen <a href="http://microsoftontheissues.com/cs/blogs/mscorp/archive/2010/02/19/the-browser-choice-screen-for-europe-what-to-expect-when-to-expect-it.aspx">more widely</a>, media across Europe, both technical and consumer, have covered a number of topics related to this milestone. Many journalists wondered which browser vendor will “win” as described by the most downloads through the Browser Choice screen.  Several wondered whether or not the Browser Choice screen will have a significant impact on market share across Europe. At Mozilla, we think it’s the consumers that win simply by the fact they are provided a choice in browsers. What do you think? Will the Browser Choice screen have a significant impact on each company’s market share?</p>
<p>A lot of last week’s discussion centered around the design of the Browser Choice screen itself: A <a href="http://www.flock.com/node/111236"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">petition filed</span></a> by a number of browser vendors calls for more visibility for the 7 browsers that are included in the Ballot Choice screen, but only become visible through scrawling to the right.  Opinions varied on the browser vendors being presented in random order on the Ballot Choice screen. Claims spanned from this being done on purpose to being an unintentional side effect of the way the Ballot Choice screen was designed.  Microsoft has since responded by making a change to the random icon order algorithm in the browser choice screen for Europe. Do you think the order of presentation has an influence on the decision a user takes?</p>
<p>Media coverage helped spark the conversation with consumers, and there was plenty of discussion in blog comments and on forums about the relative merits of the Browser Choice screen.   Those in favor, generally indicate they think it’s good people are being given a choice of browser and in the process break Microsoft’s hegemony. Those not in favor, generally indicate they think it’s bad either because they don’t think Microsoft should have to do it in the first place, or, they think that the browser choice will only serve to confuse the average web user, not help them. In fact, there was a lot of discussion as to whether consumers will be confused and dismiss the Browser Choice screen all together, either because they don’t know what it is, or worse they think it is malware.</p>
<p>Throughout the week, Internet Explorer users were sharing on Twitter and in blogs the simple fact that they encountered the Browser Choice screen.</p>
<p>We’re pleased to see the conversation take hold as it furthers awareness among consumers so they can make an informed choice about their Web browser.  Help us keep the conversation going – blog, comment, Tweet and spread the word, and take time to talk to friends and family about the Browser Choice screen.</p>
