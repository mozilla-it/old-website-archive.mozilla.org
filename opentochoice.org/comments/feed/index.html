		<description>Dear John and Mitchell;
     You are absolutely correct, the browser you use has a tremendous impact on how you interact with the Web and how you feel about what you have or have not accomplished. I have been involved in the whole Wintel consortium starting in 1984 and ending in 1996. Bill Gates&#039; business model is geared towards an old adage I heard years ago; &quot;If you can&#039;t convince them with the facts, dazzle them with bullshit.&quot; He also approached the marketplace by letting them all join in the development and growth of the IBM/Intel/Microsoft by opening their architecture to every Tom, Dick and Harry that  may be able to develop a peripheral or some application specific software. How many Beta sites does Microsoft use today? Must be over 250,000! After using IE whatever, I was reminded of a dog chasing it&#039;s tail, and of course, never catching up. A nickel for every patch and HotFix and KB whatever number, I&#039;d be rich.  My point is that I have never felt secure with Microsoft products as a whole, but they are the 800 pound gorilla in the room. But, I get to draw the line at my browser.  I have used both IE7 and Mozilla-Firefox. I am very impressed with their collaboration that provides me a browser I can trust. Mozilla-Firefox makes me feel secure when I&#039;m online and I believe they have my back. In the world of the net, that refers to and portals and WinSockets, the back door into my World Wide Web experience. As a disabled Veteran, I now think about starting a Web based business here at the house. My research and development is crucial and I need a browser from competent and committed people. I have found that in this product and I would suggest using Mozilla-Firefox as your default browser. They are proof that an open source forum and the sharing of  their fruits can be the best deal, and America has discovered that some real good things can come at no monetary cost to them. But as Americans, we pride ourselves on our ingenuity and our competence when the chips are down. The Net needed a browser with control of it&#039;s purpose and not searching for the next patch to fix the gaping hole in its backdoor. Chose Mozilla-Firefox and you can give the Valium back to the Doctor, relax and enjoy your Web experience. I have found that Mozilla has given me the best tool I could get; a secure yet robust browser that I don&#039;t have to worry about. I have so many other things to worry about, not my browser. Thank you Mozilla, John and Mitchell for providing a great product, Sincerely, Vanwyck</description>

		<description>I thought that I was bloomin&#039; crazy after some purportedly &quot;computer expert&quot; crashed my computer and caused a myriad disasters/ Then a gentleman who teaches at a local adult school rescued me with Firefox, about which I know  nothing whatsoever. All computer language is a formidable opponent to me and read as I may even the word browser is intimidating! As an English ex-pat in California I would like us all to return to the typewriter and telephone.!!!!!!!!!!!!!</description>

		<description>i am in Pacific region and i use Firefox, but I must still have IE on my PC, as it is needed to access so many other sites/apps on the internet. At least in this region...
I prefer Mozilla Firefox as there seems to be better security, something that i have always had trouble with at IE, also there is a lot more apps in Firefox one doesn&#039;t get with IE.</description>

		<description>To M.E. - you&#039;re comment about most browsers being simply a filter running MSIE under them suggests strongly that you&#039;re not really &quot;up&quot; on this subject.</description>

		<description>I found this information to be informative about peoples views and opinions. I still do not know how to choose a browser and the choices that I have to choose from. Also, if I decide that I don&#039;t want the browser that I chose, how can I can back?</description>
